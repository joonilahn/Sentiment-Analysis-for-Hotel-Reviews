Clean, large rooms, helpful staff, hot breakfast, coffee and cookies on tap, free high speed internet, nice furnishings and well equipped.  You don't pay for useless luxury BS but at the same time it doesn't feel cheap and nasty like say a Super 8. Stayed at the Monte Carlo inn in Barrie for one night, this place was cheaper and is so much better it's laughable.  Only gripe is the swarm of kids squarking across the hallways at 630am, where the heck are the parents? Oh and whilst the hot breakfast is appreciated, must we follow the USA and load everything with cheese?  Overall though, hard to go wrong here.",4,positive

No big deal. Also, the hotel was completely packed for the Family Day long weekend, so that meant the parking at the hotel was hard to come by when we returned from dinner. That was understandable. The main issue was the breakfast. It was advertised as a hot breakfast buffet, which my party and I were excited about, but when we got downstairs, not only was there not nearly enough seating for a filled-to-capacity hotel, but they had run out of eggs and sausages at 9:30. Breakfast was slated to end at 10. My husband and I couldn't stand not having a place to sit at while eating the measley bagel we scrounged up amidst the dozens of people crammed in the breakfast area, so we went to Tim Horton's instead. So, on top of the exhorbitant rate for the room ($147 for the tubing pkg when we could have gone to the Comfort inn for $123), we had to pay for breakfast, too. Not too impressed.",3,negative

The facility was wonderful and the friendly staff and service was by far the best we have ever experienced. We have been getting together every year for the past 14 years and we have stayed at many different facilities and yours ranks #1. There was not one complaint from our group. The hours of your pool and hot tub area is great as well. Many facilities close their pool down earlier in the evening and we really appreciated being able to go to the hot tub for a quick relaxing time after 11:00 PM. The breakfast was great and all that we needed. We cannot say enough and in fact many of the group asked if we could come back there again next year. Thank you so much for the wonderful experience.

This hotel is fairly new and is located conveniently right off the highway with a Tim Hortens and grocery store within walking distance. Staff were friendly and helpful.  The rooms are large and comfortable with large flat screen TV's and free WiFi. There are standard rooms and larger studio suites that have a sitting area. One downside is that mini fridges are only available in the studio suites. Suites also feature an extra large closet with full length mirrored doors, a separate room for tub and toilet. The sink area is a recessed alcove in the room. Makes it more convenient for sharing. I spent one night in an accessible room and while I don't require a room like that, it was the only one left for the night. I actually really enjoyed the walk in shower.  Breakfast is included and features a variety of options. There is always an egg and side dish, such as omelets and sausage, or scrambled eggs and hashbrowns. There are cereals, fruit, pastries, yoghurt, and a variety of breads for toasting. The warm tea biscuits were my particular favourite. If you don't have time to stop for breakfast you can take one of the brown bag breakfasts offered for those on the run. These include a bottle of water, a packaged muffin, granola bar and apple. Complimentary coffee, tea and hot chocolate is available 24 hours.  My spouse enjoyed the hot tub but I felt it was a little dirty. The pool was a nice size.  There is a smoking floor in this hotel. This hotel was very busy while I was travelling to this area and I once had to accept a smoking room. The staff did put an air purifier in the room while I was out for the afternoon, but that can't remove the smoke from the pillows and furniture. I am sure there are others who appreciate the smoking rooms, but for such a busy hotel, it would be nice to see it be smoke free.  This hotel offers very reasonable military rates which were much appreciated.",4,positive

Our housekeeper was such a doll and all the rooms i stepped into (other parents & team member rooms) were all spotless. I love that they wash the comforters for every guest THIS SHOULD BE STANDARD FOR EVERY HOTEL. They had a employee contest going on and i wanted to fill out a card but forgot so i figured this was the best way to express our delight! Keep it up, the kids cant wait to come back already!

Slight hitch at check in as our friends reservation had been lost, however he was upgraded to a suite at no extra cost for the 'inconvenience' which took all of 5 minutes to resolve. The staff were very helpful and courteous but our rooms also weren't ready and our luggage had to be stored at front desk until they were(we had arrived at 3:00-the advertised check in time). A walk to the nearby supermarket and 40 minutes later we returned to find the rooms all ready for us. The breakfast buffet was great, nice selection of hot and cold food. We used the saltwater swimming pool which was a nice temperature and clean. My only qualm about this hotel was the distance from everything. A taxi costs upwards of $15 to get to Bayfield Street and Downtown. It's a long walk to Centennial Beach (4km+) If you go to Barrie you need a car but there is plenty of free parking at the hotel. Overall, it was a nice stay and I'd recommend this hotel to anyone.

It's an easy on/off after traveling long distances in Canada. Several restaurants have available carry out surrounding the hotel. Front desk staff was friendly & helpful especially when I couldn't get the complimentary HHilton WiFi to work in my room. After some fiddling - she helped me figure it out and it worked fine the rest of my stay. The pool & hot tub were great after a long drive! We had a 2 queen bed suite for my family of four. The room itself was very spacious with a separate wet bar, refrigerator, microwave and large counter top. The two biggest drawbacks were the small bathroom (just toilet/tub) and the separate grooming area (sink, mirror, hair dryer) which was outside the bathroom in the hotel room itself. Our family would have liked a little more privacy (along with larger trash cans in the room!). The other drawback was the ""pull out"" sofa bed. It was so incredibly uncomfortable with the springs all very close to the fabric that my daughter got in it and started to cry. She ended up sleeping with me. Our older daughter ""toughed"" it out but it was pretty uncomfortable - Hilton needs to consider getting one of those ""egg carton"" mattresses before they advertise a ""pull out"" sofa bed. Breakfast the next morning was impressive for a Hampton Inn and everyone left very satisfied. They had make your own Belgian waffles, small egg/cheese omelets, cereal, juice, fruit, and a variety of breakfast treats. Hope this helps!

We paid a CAA (AAA) rate and got excellent value at a time when the hotel was full for a long weekend and baseball tournament.  The hotel recently changed over to all non-smoking. That is welcome but it will take some time for the previous smoking rooms to lose their smell. If you are at all sensitive, make sure you ask firmly for a room on a former non-smoking floor.

The housekeepers always smile, even though they have a miserable job (as far as I'm concerned) and say good morning, the front desk staff always make you feel welcome and somehow just do such a fine job that you can't help but stop and chat on your way through the lobby.

I have stayed in almost every room category too, my favourite being the king suite.  It is easily accessible from the 400 hwy. Because it is at the end of a dead-end street, it is very quiet. There is always sufficient parking at the front of the hotel. The front desk staff are excellent, always very polite and warm. There is a small shop behind the front counter with select toiletries, frozen items (ice cream etc), milk, pop, juice, some food items etc.... I know there is a pool and I think fitness/business facilities, but I've never used them so can't comment.  The rooms are always very clean and I find the beds comfortable. I prefer the suite because of the extra room and the fridge in the room (there isn't a fridge in the standard rooms). I don't believe they offer pay movies but the cable is standard and usually sufficient. Toiletries are good (make-up remover pads but no shower cap).   The breakfast is included and certainly good enough - scrambled eggs, sausage patties, waffles, cereal, breads, fruit, yoghurt.   Now to be picky - there is no restaurant on site and you would have to drive anywhere to eat at night unless you order delivery food. Yes, it's Barrie, but there is nothing immediately close. Also I would like ""real"" glasses in a room - I said I was being picky - if there's a fridge, there should be a real glass instead of paper ones. Not that big of a deal though.  In short, a very nice hotel for travelers, not ""luxury"", but definitely worth the price, clean, comfortable, welcoming and convenient.

We decided to spend the weekend in Barrie seeing as we wanted to spend Saturday skiiing at Snow Valley. After doing some research online I decided on the Hampton. Upon arrival, I was not disappointed.   Pros:  - Free breakfast  - Hot tub - Large room - Close to hwy. 400/local attractions  Cons:  - Rooms were not sound proof - Window blinds very transparent  If you are a light sleeper, you may want to consider staying elsewhere. You can very easily overhear hallway noise and doors slamming. Also, the blinds do let a lot of light in.  Apart from that, a great stay overall! Staff very helpful. If your goog out to eat downtown I would highly recommend Oscar's Oyster Bar/Grill. One of the best dining experiences I have had most recently.",5,positive

The room was very large and had two queen beds and a pull out sofa. It easily accommodated our group without feeling cramped at all. The room also had a small refrigerator and microwave oven, always a nice thing with little ones.  The hotel was immaculate and the people very friendly. We arrived late the first night and asked that our room be readied including having the pullout sofa bed made. It was ready and waiting for us as we asked.  The breakfast included was also very good and perfect for our little get away. As a Diamond Hilton member I've stayed at many Hilton brand hotels and this one was very good indeed even though the Hampton brand is not considered the top end. Despite this, the quality of this Hampton was very good and in fact better than many of the older more tired Hiltons that I've stayed at before.  I would definitely recommend this hotel and would be happy to come back. Don't forget a bathing suit though (like we did), there's a great pool that would be a shame to not use!",4,positive

On past visits to Barrie on business I'd always stayed at the Holiday Inn or Holiday Inn Express but the Hampton is now my new go-to hotel in Barrie and I've already booked for another 2-night stay in two weeks.  I stayed in a King Studio, very comfortable with a bar area complete with sink, microwave, fridge and granite countertops. There is a separate sink/dressing area outside of the bathroom, also with granite countertops, a sitting area, desk with wifi internet access. The bed was super comfortable with a good assortment of pillows.  A hot breakfast buffet is offered in the morning with fruit, yogurt, omelettes, bacon, homefries, homemade waffles, juices, baked goods, cereal, coffee & tea. Coffee and tea is also available in the lobby all day and evening. I didn't use any of the hotel amenities this week, but there is a pool and gym so I will explore that on my next business stay in two weeks.  There is no restaurant on site apart from the breakfast offerings but centrally located in Barrie for off-site choices.  All staff I encountered were pleasant and helpful. If you have to be away from home, this is an excellent choice in Barrie and I've recommended in to my coworkers and associates.

Lastly, I like the idea that the feather duvets are washed after every customer (have you seen their advertising for this, it's all over the place).

Comfortable bed, light duvet and choice of hard or soft pillows. Quiet surroundings. Ample free parking.  Complimentary breakfast. Adequate selection of hot and cold items.  ONE NEGATIVE; Only disappointment was that we could not enjoy the pool because the entire evening it was occupied by several young kids. A woman had a baby under 12 months in the pool for quite some time. It did not appear to have a protective pool diaper used for sanitary reasons. One recommendation would be to have the pool assigned ""adults only over age 16"" for the last hour or two prior to closing (i.e. 9:00 - 10:00 PM , 9:00 - 11:00 PM) depending on when the pool closes for the night. It's impossible to swim with kids jumping, splashing, throwing balls and screaming as well as running from pool to jacuzzi. We finally left the pool area at 10:30 PM and they were still there. When is bedtime ??? Some hotels and resorts post this ""adults hour"" swim time and it appears to work well. Management seems concerned about improving situations so hopefully this will rate their consideration.  Other than this incident we would recommend this facility and we would stay here again.

One gets off at Essa, turns right and then left to find it on Byrne Drive. It is handy and in a good location. We will be staying again!  At first we were given the key to what turned out to be a very spacious room due to the fact that it was wheel-chair accessible. It is a mystery why we were assigned this, but the desk clerk said it sometimes happens with online reservations. We would have loved to have stayed in it due to its size but there was an adjoining room, which is a no-no for us light sleepers. Our actual room seemed almost claustrophic after the gracious wc-a room. lol  The lobby is nice with the breakfast area adjoining it. The front desk staff was accomodating to us with our room change request. (Btw, she said the rooms on the top floor often get complaints as the roof fans can bother sleepers. This doesn't seem very good.) There are several coffee stations near the front desk which certainly was a nice feature for those who like their coffee 24-7. In addition, there is even a microwave in a little store which anyone can use. Microwave popcorn was available to purchase for late night munchers. :-)  Our room was very comfortable and the king-size bed especially so. There is a large screen t.v. Extra pillows were appreciated. The bathroom was small but adequate and clean.  Breakfast was efficient and the staff friendly. There was a large variety of food which was replenished constantly. Even scones were offered, which was a treat. The only complaint I could make is that there is no recycling available in either this eating area or in the rooms. In this day and age, I consider this quite an oversight by the chain.  All in all, we had a good night and will definitely return. There are several gas stations close-by so fueling up the car in anticipation of the next day's drive is easy.
 
 
 Room Tip:  Avoid top floor, our usual favourite, due to fan noise from roof.

The pool area and fitness area were in the basement, but there were lots of big windows and it made for a great afternoon in the pool for kids and adults alike. There was an outdoor area beside the pool with some patio sets and BBQ (but no umbrellas for shade).  The breakfast was typical of the Hampton Inn experience - everything you could want. Despite the fact that there was tour bus at the hotel and they cleaned out the buffet, the staff did a great job at restocking the food.  Check out was a breeze and the staff provided a map and was helpful in pointing us to our destination.   The location was great. Easy to find off Hwy 400, but far enough away that you didn't feel like you were right beside the highway.

The person we spoke with on the phone assured us it was a pet-friendly hotel as long as our dog was under 65 lbs which he is. We then got to Barrie and were greeted with a smile by the tall blonde lady at the counter. When she saw my father and our dog she first asked if they needed a ""person with disabilities"" room because of the dog, which my parents of course said no and clarified that he was just their regular pet, and that they'd just like their regular room. The lady then apologized, gave us an upgrade which was lovely of her (especially on thanksgiving weekend), and proceeded to let us go through WITH OUR DOG. The day after my parents checked in, my parents received a phone call asking if they had a dog in the room (keep in mind our dog rarely barks), my parents of course said yes and that they were so delighted that the hotel was pet friendly. The hotel 'manager' (Oct 8th/ 2012) said that they weren't pet friendly and started to accuse my parents of bringing the dog in ON PURPOSE. My parents (being older) said that no that certainly wasn't the intention and that the taller blonde lady that checked them in saw them and that they didn't mean to cause any trouble. Not only did she say okay we'll just make sure there are no damages to the hotel room in the morning when you're on your way out, which my parents said yes that's perfectly fine, but then she called them up AGAIN, during our family visit and said that the taller blonde woman was denying the fact she let my parents in with the dog! So my parents of course said well you can check your cameras, and we did CONFIRM with her as well that we had one with us. So not only did the company not UPHOLD their 'customer is always right' or even the fact that THEIR staff wasn't made aware of this sooner is absolutely embarrassing on their behalf. I pity you Hampton Inn. I'd also love to thank your staff personally for RUINING our family thanksgiving and kicking my parents out of your hotel over this stupid matter when there were not even 3 cars parked in your parking lot as well as when it was 6:30pm and my parents were leaving early tomorrow morning anyway. You are PATHETIC. Oh and if any of the employers out there or even Hampton Inn owner would like to know: the managers name was Bonnie and unfortunately we can't remember the Blonde woman's name either but she was working oct 7th/ 2012 evening.

After spending a very frustrating night trying to maintain a remote desktop connection into my PC back at work I simply gave up. Speedtest reported a speed of 110kbps (kilobits, not bytes) thats 13.75KB /sec. It's no wonder I couldn't get any work done. I called their ""tech support"" and they assured me that it was ""high speed"" and then tried to convince me that you need ""quite the connection for remote desktop"". I had it set to the lowest bandwidth settings (DIAL UP) and it was still useless.  This was over an in-room hard wired connection. No VPN or anything fancy and my laptop worked fine at the conference center and RDP was flaswless even at high color settings so I know it wasn't an issue on my end. Claiming these rooms offer ""high speed internet"" just because it comes over an ethernet cable instead of the phone line is simply misleading.

Very clean, modern, fine breakfast, suffiicient amenities... however a big issue for me during my recent one night stay was a poor Heating/AC unit....it cut in & out all night & appeared to have no ""fan only"" setting... this led to a sleepness night. There were also no operation instructions anywhere to be found! Hotel seemed less sound proof than normal... footsteps & thumping from above & noise from adjoining rooms on either side further contributed to the sleeplessness. Girl at check-in I would describe as very passive to slightly unfriendly. Not a bad facility.. but certainly below Hampton standards i've come to expect!",3,negative

The room was spacious and clean, the staff were very friendly and courteous and the hotel facilities (fitness room, breakfast, etc.) are just fine. The only odd thing was the antiquated business centre which, for a relatively new hotel had old out-of-date computers and printers. The hotel is in a convenient location just off the 400 though not anywhere you could walk for food. The staff provided a list of places that deliver to the hotel which worked fine for us. As to some of the other reviews posted - there are rules for hotel stays. Be aware of and respect them and your stay should be problem free.

For some reason all other devices would connect but laptop wouldn't. Facility was clean and bright which makes it very inviting.  Staff was helpful and cheerful which again makes it inviting. We has a number of kids hockey teams which usually means a lot of noise with parents usually but we did not hear a peep. Now this is more due to the parents and kids but i would like to believe that the staff has warned the teams to be in control.  Parking lot was tight to find space due to recent snow but you could always park around back of building if you wanted to.

Unfortunately, we think that the management chooses the front-desk staff according to looks. Both blondes that we had contact with were nice but lacked something in the cerebral sphere. :-)  The room was a large one with wheelchair access. It is not right that one can request this type of room (for the king size bed) even though not in need of it. What happens when the wheelchair access rooms have been given to non-needing people????  We found the bed far too soft. The T.V. was not clear at all. However, the free bottle of water with a granola bar awaiting us was nice. Furthermore, there were coffee bags and a popcorn microwave bag in the room. Awesome!  Breakfast in the morning was wonderful.

In the lobby is a complimentary coffee nook where you can brew individual coffee pods and choose a flavoured cream. I also noticed that they offered a free Barrie Examiner newspaper. The room was clean and updated. The pillows were a combination of soft and hard, so you could have a choice. The bathroom had hair products but I thought that Hampton could be a little more female-friendly by offering a make-up mirror. My husband and daughter used the pool and hot tub but found the pool chiily so stuck to the hot tub and enjoyed that. They said that there was no one else around and had the place to themselves. The breakfast was very well done with hot food like scrambled eggs and sausage, oatmeal and an assortment of cereals, fruit and yogurt. My husband and I were there early at 8:00 am but when we checked out and my daughter decided she was hungry at 9:00 am, they were out of some of her favorite items, like fresh fruit salad.

I have stayed at this hotel four times in 2012, always for a full week and have never encountered any issues. The rooms are spacious, modern and clean. The complimentary breakfast, while not outstanding does the job and helps keep expenses in check. The flat screen TV is smaller, I'd say about 32 inches, but I was happy to get CNN. The Internet service has been flawless on each and every one of my stays. As a business traveler, my only issue is that the affordable rates do attract many child-sports family's. While I welcome sharing the common areas, as may be expected, the absence of proper parenting occasionally results in frustration when using the elevator to ascend or descend. My experience in the room, however has always been quiet. The staff has always been polite and helpful, however being in the customer service business, I have to acknowledge the evening shift representative. Four months passed between my previous visit in October 2012, but on the evening of my second-nights stay in March 2013, while leaving the hotel to grab dinner, ""Grant"" immediately recognized me and greeted me by name. I had been impressed by his attentiveness throughout my previous stays, but I felt compelled to pass along this feedback as he is a definite asset to this team. Sadly, this will be my last visit to Barrie, however, should I have the need for accommodations within a 30 mile radius for either business or pleasure, this hotel will definitely be first on the list.",4,positive

Clean and comfortable room,and a pretty darn good breakfast ( included in our price), an exercise room and what would be a nice, though small, indoor pool except that it was filled with kids ( perils of March Break). We asked for a room with a small fridge and microwave which were not in our room when we checked in,...a call to the front desk said it would be brought up shortly. After waiting 15-20 minutes we decided to head out expecting them to be delivered in our absence... 2 hours latr we got back with some things that had to go in the fridge only to discover the fridge still hadn't been delivered. Another call did in fact produce the fridge and microwave within 5 min but we were told it would be about half an hour before the fridge was cold. Breakfast the next day offered a nice selection of cereals, fruit, yoghurt, muffins bagels etc and make your own waffles. However, they need someone to keep on top of the supplies... there were no more forks, they didn't have any bread, and then no waffle batter. As breakfast lasts until 10 and this was around 9, I'm certain they refilled everything, but given the number of people, they should have been prepared.   One of my biggest disappointments however was the lack of consideration of environmental issues. There were newspapers provided, but no recyling boxes in the rooms nor in the lobby. They used styrofoam plates, paper cups and plastic knives and forks for the breakfast. I would have thought by now, companies would be supporting waste reduction programs. Ironically, posters in the elevators promoted carpooling and recyling of ""old Stuff"", but the hotel isn't practicing what it preaches.

Our suite was the largest open concept suite room I've been in with 2 queen beds, pull out sofa and a very large open carpet area for kids to enjoy. Make sure you upgrade with a family. I complimented the cleaning lady I met in the hall how the entire hotel was clean and seemed brand new. She said the building was about 5 years old and said, ""we are the best cleaners in town"". I believe it! The pool was a nice size and the breakfast area was very good with lots of modern décor and seating plus a plasma TV to watch. The only negative I would make was the breakfast lady who was not so friendly and was actually pushing the doors to the food area closed on people as they were trying to get one last trip in before closing. I thought this was very rude. Perfect stop for our trip to the ski hills and close to grocery stores, 400 highway and restaurants.

The hotel is fairly new so the common areas and rooms are in good condition as you would expect. We stayed in suite and our friends that we were traveling with stayed in a studio room. The finishes are similar except the suite affords you much more space. For the marginal price difference, I would recommend anyone staying with more than two people (e.g. families in town skiing) to upgrade to a suite. The wet bar area, mini-fridge and microwave would be great to pack a lunch to go or keep fresh food items on hand for breakfast or a snack.  If you choose this hotel for the continental breakfast, don't. The dining area was over-crowded and the staple items weren't refreshed quickly enough to keep up with the demand. Although a nice feature of the hotel is the complementary tea/hot beverage station in the lobby - nice touch!  I don't have too much to say about service... Our room was not refreshed while we were out for the entire day and at 1am when we returned, we had to call for fresh towels so that we would have them for our morning shower. The staff were pleasant enough, but you can tell it's just a job for them... neither the front desk staff that took our call or the attendant that delivered the towels apologized or seemed to think it a problem that our room had been missed.",4,positive

169569424,barrie/ca/154980/1238832/169569424.html,Hampton Inn &amp; Suites by Hilton Barrie,"The Hampton Inn & Suites is conveniently located near highway 400 and is centrally located in Barrie. You would require a car as there is not a lot within walking distance other than Tim Hortons and Zehr's grocery store.  We chose this hotel initially due to it having the latest closing time for their pool and the earliest start time for their breakfast in comparison to other nearby hotels. However, this hotel has so much more to offer. It is very clean with a lot of great amenities. We stayed on a Friday night in July, and while the hotel was fully booked, we did not have any problems with crowds or noise. The employees were all very friendly including the housekeepers, breakfast bar attendants and the front desk. This is the only hotel that I have stayed in where I was consistently greeted every time I walked past the front desk.  They have a complimentary beverage station at the front desk where they offer tea, coffee and hot chocolate. They offer the best complimentary hot breakfast that I have seen in any hotel within this price range.   We stayed in a standard Queen room which had ample space including the very spacious bathroom. While the room had a nice workstation they also offer a lap desk which was a unique addition. This next point would not make or break me booking a hotel room; however, I have never seen a hotel with so many electrical outlets. When I travel with my family we usually have numerous electronic devices to charge overnight which always results in the need to unplug lamps in the room. This was not required here as the hotel actually had more outlets then my family could put to use.  While the pool is not big, it was very clean, offered a lot of towels and was absolutely perfect to relax in after a long day.   I believe the hotel offers Safety Deposit Boxes at the front desk. However, the only amenity that I missed having was a safety deposit box inside our hotel room.",5,positive

The chairs and bench seating are so low at the tables (if you could find a clean one) that I had to sit on a stool at the meeting table in the center. Hampton Inns are our favorite hotels and have stayed in a lot of them and was very happy when they built this one in Barrie.

There was dry cereal, oatmeal, waffle-makers, bread and bagels, yoghurt, fresh fruit, juice, coffee, tea, hot chocolate, eggs, muffins... The only thing I would have liked to see was bacon! The room itself was clean and well-maintained. The TV was a nice flat screen, although we did not get any HD channels. The location is good, it is not far from the main drag.

I booked the room from the hotel website as the price was very good for the room type and amenities. We were very impressed with the size and quality of the room, the service from the staff and an excellent hot buffet breakfast (included in the price of the room). But what made the stay stand out was the service. We had an issue with a malfunctioning toilet during the second evening of our stay and call to reception to report it. Within 10 minutes of calling we actually had the hotel manager in the room fixing the problem (the maintenance guy wasn't available immediately, so she came herself rather than make us wait). the problem was fixed and we went on to enjoy the rest of our stay. The reception staff also took the time the following morning to pay a visit back to our room to make sure everything was still all ok.  If you are in need of a spacious clean room at a good rate and enjoy great service, I would not hesitate in recommending the Hampton Inn & Suites.

Hotel is easy to get to, close to Hwy 400.   Room was very spacious. Had a small fridge, sink and microwave near the doorway. Opened up to the room which had a sofabed, desk with 2 chairs on either side, large space in the middle of the room and king bed on the far side of the room. Also a closet, bathroom sink outside of the bathroom.   Living area of room was carpeted. Tiles at the front door area and where the bathroom sink was.   Room was very clean although grout in between tiles on the floor and on bathroom walls definitely could have been cleaner. Also, paint on ceiling above shower was starting to peel. Small changes that Housekeeping and Maintenance could improve on.   Breakfast was good. Had fresh fruit, yogurt, juices, coffees, teas, cereals, waffles, bagels, English muffins, bread, muffins, scrambled eggs and sausages, Breakfast room was spacious although was very crowded during our stay. On the way back to the elevators, we later saw a sign saying that there was additional seating in another room for breakfast. I recommend that this sign be placed at the entrance to the breakfast seating instead of near the elevators because you don't see it when you get off the elevator.   Front desk staff was pleasant. Coffee, tea and hot chocolate was available beside the front desk.   Pool was nice and clean. Hot tub was also nice.   Stayed here because we were skiing at Horseshoe Valley.

The person at the front desk was not very helpful, though admittedly, she appeared to be alone on a busy Saturday night.   This is silly, but I want an actual glass in my room - not a plastic or paper cup. I asked the front desk, but apparently, none to be found. The hotel claims it is 'green', but everything is in plastic and paper. Alright, it comes from recycled material, I get it... But, if you go through 'tons' of plastic and paper cups, and plates (for breakfast) on a daily basis, you are still generating lots of waste. The hotel could use a few 'dishwashers' and some real dishes, that would truly be 'green'. Oh, did I mention I want a real glass in my room (especially at that price point)!

I was in room 221, and when I complained about a very loud electrical hum, so loud in fact I could not sleep, I was given approximately $15.00 off the room and ear plugs!!! I was told the hotel was full and that was all they could do for me. The hum was so loud, it sounded like there were multiple bathroom fans all running at the same time. I cannot understand how a hotel owner could think it is okay to subjected a guest to such a noise when they are paying top dollar for a hotel room to SLEEP in. I will never stay there again and may even avoid all Hilton's as a result! The staff were very professional but did not offer me any reason to ever stay at a Hilton again!

The complementary breakfast wasn't all that bad, the hot tub and salt water pool were both working and decently sized. Very well run hotel and all the front desk staff were friendly. Wi-Fi was good. Great place to stay and have a good rest.  On the downside they don't have a restaurant or bar so there was really nowhere to socialize. My kids were bored to death. Their security guard patrols the hallway and though she seemed to keep missing the teenagers stomping around making a racket at 2 am she demanded I shut my door at 11. I'd left it open about an inch while I sat around inside chatting with one of the other parents. I should have told her to screw off since we were barely making a sound and there's no reason for a ""policy"" that we can't leave our door slightly open after 11.   So be aware the hotel is a great place to rest, but not a place to go with a group and expect to have much fun. You can only spend so much time sitting around the pool and there was really nothing else to do to keep kids entertained.

I am in Barrie quite often for my business dealings,   and this quickly became my hotel of choice.  It is superior to the others in the area by a large margin.  As to where the other main hotels in Barrie all have that dingy, dusty,  almost dirty smell in each room  (which I suppose is the cause of airborne dust particles not being well cleaned over time),  the rooms here at the Hampton contrarily seem to always smell of crispness and cleanliness, and look the part to.  This is big to me.  I'm legit OCD, so I need a clean room. This rooms here are fit for a king, and an OCD one, which is no small compliment obviously.  The dark hardwood furniture is a nice touch.  It is heavy-looking and charming   In all other areas a person may judge this establishment, the hotel is superb.  The offering and services are second to none to any other establishment in Barrie,  and when you factor in the pricing, I think pound for pound it's better than any hotel  in a major city like Toronto or Montreal.   I highly recommend staying here if in Barrie.   You will find yourself overcome in customer satisfaction and customer delight. Trustttt.  A small word of warning though.  While i was here last   A female receptionist, told me about a hamburger restaurant near to the lobbies exit, in walking distance.  I don't remember the name or where it was exactly,  but in the end it was quite bad and avoidable.  I got the CornyCon Triple Cheese Burger or something like that.  It was just far too corny, as in... well... just plain too corny.  Wheel barrows of pure, very salty canned-corn getting shovelled into your face.  And so cheesy as well. Cheesiest burger I ever saw. Made it hard to approach even haha.  I knew I would get sticky just for getting near to it at all haha. Felt sticky looking at it.  But I did.  And then I felt really ""not good"" after.  I didn't get sick exactly,  but it did not sit well with me the rest of my stay.  I felt so sickly and bothered by it.  Bloated, pain, anxious...  Just avoid the burger spot near lobby!!   Remember:  salads are happy,  burgers  are  fat.  I'm not saying it was the resto or Barrie's fault. I understand a hamburger is a bad choice and I brought it on myself. If a hamburger were a person, it would be a fat Chris Farley looking couch potato, and a salad would be a fitness trainer who is Nathalie Portman. Am I right?   Anyways,   just   avoid   this   Burger at all costs,   this Burger  is just so fat and annoying.   trust me my friends

Very clean and super roomy.We had a family suite and more than enough room for two parents and two girls. I'm super picky about cleanliness and it was excellent. Surprisingly quiet at night even though the place was full. Only challenege was coming in later at night after the competition and discovering there were very few parking spaces left. Going up and down the parking ramp a little scary as it was snowing and in the morning it hadn't been plowed or salted. The breakfast was plentiful, great quality and would definitely stay there again and highly recommend. Really great representation of the Hampton :)

As a HH member and frequent business traveler I have come to expect 3 basics;   1. have good WIFI - this is a must because I spend my evenings working  2. have a good fitness center - this one is great and the pool and hot tub overlooking the forest is really special  3. have all the healthy breakfast options - check here too   I almost always order a fridge to my room because of diet restrictions etc and although it appears I did'nt on this trip the staff was more then accommodating and delivered my fridge quickly upon request.   I generally stay loyal to the Hilton brand as a business traveler because of these facts and this property was notable.

We called from the highway (not the driver!) on our way here and literally ""got the last room"" left. That made me nervous as to what that room might be like, but I was VERY pleasantly surprised when we arrived! The check in was efficient and painless. The front desk clerk was very nice and informed us that the hotel was full and that if we had any noise issues, to not hesitate to call her and she would deal with them. Got to the room and LOVED it!!!! HUGE ROOM!!! Two queens and a sofa bed, separate kitchen area with big counter top, mini fridge, sink, and microwave. Bathroom was sparkling clean and I loved that the sink area is separated for maximum efficiency when myself and my two teenage daughters are trying to get ready in the morning. I did not call the front desk about the noise, and there was lots, up until I fell asleep (with some help from a sleep aid) at 11:30pm. I stepped out into the hall a couple of times and glared at the runners and once, a tipsy dad, but I couldn't bring myself to bother that nice girl at the desk. I'm sure she was dealing with noise complaints from every corner of the hotel, all night long. I cannot fault this hotel, but I do have a message for parents:   PARENTS - HAVE CONTROL OVER YOUR CHILDREN!!! A HOTEL IS NOT A GYMNASIUM. THE LONG HALLS ARE NOT MEANT FOR RUNNING UP AND DOWN WHILE SCREAMING AND HOLLERING LIKE A LUNATIC!!! THERE ARE OLD PEOPLE, SICK PEOPLE, TIRED PEOPLE, PEOPLE WITH HEADACHES AND PEOPLE WHO HAVE TO GET AN EARLY START IN THE MORNING, STAYING IN THE HOTEL WITH YOU AND YOUR ROWDY FRIENDS!!! YOUR HEAVY DOOR DOES NOT NEED TO BE OPENED AND SLAMMED 30 TIMES AN HOUR!   Sadly, not all of the noise was coming from children, but a good deal of it from the ""adults"" in the group too. I suspect we were in the company of some tournament attendees, and I've had the experience before. I swear some people put their kids in rep sports just so they can travel around and party with the other parents while their kids rip around unsupervised. Remember parents, some day, you will be in a hotel without your kids and will want the same courtesies that I and my fellow travellers without young kids do - namely respect, peace and quiet. Grow up!  This hotel is excellent and I get why hotels take tournament groups in. You can't fault the hotel because people act like a-holes!",5,positive

The room was nice and fresh and the front desk staff couldn't be nicer. I believe the clerk's name was Lauren. She even left a voice mail in our room making sure the room was to our satisfaction and to call down if we needed anything.

We were stuck in bumper to bumper traffic the whole way there and couldn't wait to finally get to the hotel to relax. When we arrived at our room, we were very disappointed. The ""suite"" was like a regular room with a microwave. The rugs and couch were dingy and gross and the bathroom was tiny. We overlooked all of the filth because we were eager to rest before the concert. When we arrived back to the hotel after the concert our room was very warm, so we turned on the air conditioning. It was incredibly loud. There was ticking and clanking sounds coming from the vent which made for a difficult night sleep. At around 6 a.m., we were woken by a loud bang noise that continued every few minutes. I thought that maybe it was the maid banging stuff around and that it would stop shortly. After ten minutes, I looked into the hall and determined that it was actually the door to the stairs that was slamming shut as people made their way to the lobby. The walls were so paper thin, that we could also hear every word our fellow guests were saying as they made their way downstairs. I am normally a VERY heavy sleeper but the noise was so loud that sleep was impossible.   You can imagine our disappointment and frustration after such a long day of driving, to have such a restless night sleep, and such an early morning. Not a good place to go if you are looking to relax and unwind. Hopefully they will fix the slamming door situation ASAP.

At approximately 2 a.m. it started and did not stop. I voiced my opinion but this did nothing. This was not the fault of the staff. It was the room and mainly the construction of the walls. This type of noise should not have been troublesome.   Looking back I do wish that I did not take the room and just got up early in the morning and travelled down to my destination or stayed at a better constructed hotel.  Beware if you looking for a good night sleep. Chances are you will get it at any Hampton Inn but this one has paper thin walls.",2,negative

The first night we stayed we were in the same wing as a hockey team where some of the people got back to their rooms quiet late and made a lot of noise. However, it was short lived. Our room was quiet nice overlooking a wooded areas. The only issue with our room was the drawers which look like they had been hit by some furniture and the bottom drawer would not close all the way. I did notify the staff of this issue but we did not request a move as we were there for only a couple of nights. Overall, would recommend this hotel to others.",5,positive

On check out, however the last staff that I interacted with, I asked her to correct my address on my receipt, and have it ready for me when I checked out. She did not have it corrected and not ready when I checked out. She did not seem the normal level of efficient staff that we are used to at this Hampton. In general we were satisfied with our stay. The pool was warmer than normal which was lovely. Other guests shared a blow up ball and pool noodles with us, which was wonderful, we never remember to bring these, and it would be a great suggestion for the hotel to provide a few blow up balls or pool noodles for kids to play with in the pool.",4,positive

We were 20 min. from Horseshoe and 30 min. from Mt. St. Louis / Moonstone. (It is also very close to Snow Valley). We stayed in a spacious suite with two queen beds and a pull out couch, perfect for our family of four, giving each kid a bed of their own. The suite included a wet bar, with fridge, and microwave and sink - great for snacks. Their was a work station set up in the room which was useful for finishing up some work and setting up our computer. We had complimentary wi-fi which we were able to use with no problems. The room was clean and had ample storage. We requested a quiet floor to stay on and noise was not a problem. The free breakfast included a variety of food from omlettes, hard boiled eggs, a waffle station, sausages, tater tots, cereal, oatmeal, fruit, yogurt and all the breakfast beverages - a great way to fill up before a day of skiing. Overall the Hampton Inn and Suites Barrie, is an ideal location for a mini ski vacation - great value for the price.",4,positive

I only have one negative and I'll add this first as I noticed it on an email early in the day.  At 10:00 AM we had a room charge of the first night stay put on my Credit Card; that credit card was just to hold the room, not pay for it as it was an American card and we also had a Canadian Card. When we checked in, the Credit Card we wanted to pay with was also charged. We asked about getting the room hold card charges taken off; it will take up to five business days. Not a big deal really, just don't know why this was done.  Now onto the positive.  Staff on check in was quite friendly.  Our room was great. We were in a nice suite (Room 621). It slept 2 adults and 3 teens comfortably. Really nice big room. It was extremely clean; the housekeeping staff do a great job maintaining the rooms. The room had a nice little mini kitchen with microwave, mini fridge and sink; bathroom was large with a separate sink area; beds were so comfortable. I really liked the room decor too. It was fresh and classy.   The hot buffet breakfast was really nice, lots of seating and a great selection including fruit salad, yogurt, cold cereals, breakfast potatoes, scrambled eggs, waffles, really good slow cooked oatmeal and lots of variety in coffee, tea and juice. Location of this hotel was central to everything in Barrie.   If we are in Barrie area again we would definitely stay here again; we'd just be sure to book our room on the card we want to use and realize they put the charge on well before room cancellation time.

Everything from start to finish was terrific and I only hope that I remember all of the details. First of all, the price, for all that is offered, is a bargain. Our room was immaculately kept and the housekeepers deserve huge kudos for it. The beds and pillows were comfortable. Although it is only a short drive off the highway, it was very quiet and we heard no noise from the highway or the road close by, for both nights we were there. All staff we saw were polite, helpful and genuinely seemed happy to be there - always a nice thing. The salt water pool and hot tub were clean and our kids loved it - they practically lived in the pool the entire time we were there. The breakfast was amazing. They offer the usual bagels, muffins, toast, yogourt, fruit, oatmeal and cereal, but they also offer some hot options. One morning it was scrambled eggs and bacon, the other morning it was cheese omelettes and peameal bacon. The real breakfast star, however, was the fresh waffles. You pour the batter in the waffle iron and make them yourself, which means you can make a full waffle, half, quarter... whatever. You also can top them with a variety of toppings - syrup, whipped cream, chocolate sauce, raspberry sauce, chocolate chips, sprinkles and oreo cookie crumbs. Delicious!! What also was great was all of the little touches that the Hampton offered. When we checked in, I noticed a platter of cookies beside the front desk, for anyone who wants one (we didn't indulge). In the morning, they had bagged breakfasts to go - in case someone didn't have time to sit and eat, and didn't just want an apple or banana. They also offered complimentary tea, coffee and hot chocolate around the clock. Little things like that can go a long way.

Our business meeting that is located at the hotel, offers breakfast to us for no additional cost, however I enjoy the breakfast offered in the lobby better. The waffles are a huge treat for me!!! They are delicious.   The only downside (which I guess isn't a downside at all!) is that this hotel is always very busy and sometimes it's hard to get a room. Their target guests seem to be kids sports teams so the pool is sometimes overly crowded which makes it hard for me to enjoy my hot tub time. But we have kids too so I get it.

The service was wonderful right from the moment I walked through the doors. While checking me in the friendly front desk clerk asked if I was a Hilton member and when I said I hadn't signed up yet she said she would do it for me if I would like and slide the paper under my door later so I could get points for this stay! Excellent!! The room itself was extremely clean with lots of room to move around. I had a standard room with 2 queens. The bed was comfy with lots of pillows, both firm and soft. The bathroom was well appointed with Neutrogena toiletries. On one of the beds was the laptop try so often found in hotel rooms but this one had an envelope with my name on it. I opened it to find a lovely hand written note welcoming me to the hotel and letting me know if I needed anything at all to contact the front desk. I thought this was a great personal touch! I had to leave fairly early so having breakfast start at 6 am was helpful although I did notice that there were bags made up for any travellers who had to leave before breakfast was ready! I had one of the small omelettes and it was delicious. Everything else looked good too but I was in a hurry and just had a quick bite. There is a salt water pool that I did not use but I think is a nice touch....something different. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone travelling in the area.

It was a good choice. I can’t really say anything too bad about this Hotel. What I will Praise is the Hilton Honours system. I don’t work for Hilton, but honestly it’s a really neat system. I can check-in online ahead of time and choose my room. As you may know I hate ground floor rooms so the ability to choose my floor etc is fantastic. My wife and I looked up the building on google maps, chose a room on the forest side and had a nice private view. When you arrive they have keys ready and you breeze right up to your room. But on to the hotel. The pool is nice, its on the back side almost on the basement level. It has a nice hot tub and some chair around to dry off on. The breakfast in the morning was the best I’ve had in a while. Waffle irons, a folded egg omelet, the usual cereals, fruit, very good hashbrowns. I realize that most of this food would be scoffed at by connoisseurs but, its fine to get up and go with. The hotel is at the end of a little street. It was very quiet, any cars you saw were coming to the hotel. It has very easy access to a gas station and then to Highway 400. The room was nothing to write home about. I don’t remember Good water pressure. No room safe which, is kinda necessary nowadays.

From the first time months ago when we started to make arrangements with the manager, Melanie, we were so impressed with her professionalism and attention to detail. This continued throughout my contact with her over the months before my wedding. This past weekend all my guests arrived at the Hampton Inn and Suites and everyone was so impressed with their rooms and the cleanliness of the hotel and rooms. The front desk staff were helpful and attentive. Nothing was a problem. When my husband and I realized that our guests did not want to drive to the wedding venue, we quickly approached the front desk on Saturday morning and instantly, the front desk got taxis ordered for the evening and took care of everything. We were so impressed with their willingness to help out and take over organizing the transportation. All our guests commented on how wonderful the breakfast was. It included hot and cold options and a variety of coffee and tea was available all day long. A few of our guests enjoyed the indoor pool which was an excellent option for the children who were part of my wedding weekend. The location of the Hampton Inn and Suites makes it accessible for out of town guests as it is just off Hwy 400. I can't say enough about how wonderful the staff were most especially the manager, Melanie.

You must pay for a proper internet connection. Special requests in reservation emails are not always honoured, and you have to make a second request at the front desk to get what you want. In this hotel, the double coffee station has been reduced to one station located at the opposite end of the breakfast area. This is an attempt by management to cut costs? Guests have to walk back and forth between two areas to get coffee, and the coffee pot was often empty. The service attendant, also had to run back and forth to service two areas. Not brilliant. How much did the hotel save? There is another annoying trend in business traveller hotels that I have noticed. I often overhear the group rate, which is significantly lower. Many business traveller hotels prefer to give heavy discounted prices for guests using their conference services or other special event groups as opposed to supporting the independent business traveller who uses their services a dozen or more days a year. Another poor decision. Finally, the hotel rooms are starting to look tired at this location. If you are going to raise pricing, then upgrade the room. I travel about 100 nights in any given year, so I am always on the lookout for a chain of hotels, that will service my needs. The Hilton family has been great over the years, but inflated prices, reduced services, less Honour Points & tired rooms, eventually opens doors elsewhere.

The hotel is newer and in good shape, but could use some attention from the maintenance staff, i.e. caulking, trim etc. Breakfast is good and it varies day-to-day, a pleasant change. Housekeeping could UP their game, i.e. don't put the fitted sheet on inside-out and DO vacuum up large dirt on the carpets each day (they did rectify both issues when reported, but it shouldn't come to that). A good and recommended hotel, but they could be so much more with just a bit more attention to detail. Cheers, Paul

Free coffee, tea and hot chocolate in the lobby (available around the clock) was very much appreciated.",5,positive

But...prior to checking in we entered the hotel and asked if we could see a room and get a rate before deciding to stay there. We were told they could not allow us to see a room, and she wasn't sure what the rate was soooo after a long awkward pause I asked if she could please look up the rate for us. Once she completed the rate inquiry we then asked if there was a CAA discount available, she continued to tell us there was, she thought it was 10% but wasn't to sure. After I again prompted her to look it up, she wasn't able to find the CAA rate and it really didn't feel like she wanted to look it up for us, it really felt like we were a giant inconvenience for her that night. If I didn't feel comfortable knowing that I have never been disappointed in a Hampton before I would have walked out and went to the brand new 4 Points Sheraton right next door, but we put aside her grumpy attitude and checked in for the night. As soon as the transaction was completed it was like a light switch went off and we were suddenly worth talking to. As mentioned above once we checked in everyone was really nice, the pool was nice, hot tub was hot and the rooms were very clean!

OK I will take it. Sorry she said you have to book on line. Short story it was not a Hotel Pop up it was something entirely different. I got my invoice from Registration.com for $268.49 + 21.00 fee US funds. You heard me right. When I called back to the Hotel they said Expedia paid $120.08. Visa told me a Third Party Scam. The Hotel was Great. The rooms and service excellent. The Free Breakfast to die for. Pool and hot tub and fitness room superb. BOOK DIRECT as the price with CAA $135.00 per night. Canadian.

It was not what I expect from Hampton Inn. The service was okay at check-in but not very welcoming, maybe I'm used to southern hospitality....  The room was fine, except for some small but bad stains on the curtains and the upholstery on the little bench had a large stain. The bathrooms and beds were fine, the tv was great with lots of channels available.  The parking lot is not big enough and many guests had to park in the mud along the edge of the lot. The indoor pool was nice and warm and big but while sitting in the indoor hot tub, I felt something crawl on my neck and there was a big ant hill on the pool deck behind me. It was very cold and snowing out so the ants seem to have decided to check into the pool area, especially around the hot tub there were a lot of bugs dead and alive.....  I know it is not the hotel's fault but there was a very loud party that went nuts about 2:30 AM next door to us. We called the front desk and it appeared to be dealt with swiftly...The room doors, no matter how quietly you try to shut them, are VERY loud in this hotel.  We tried the hotel breakfast after our restless night but the fruit looked way past its prime so got breakfast elsewhere...There are a few restaurants nearby and it is easy on/off Hwy 400 from the hotel.

Truly enjoy that at the Hamptons, you can help yourself to a complimentary hot beverage at any time of the day. Hot breakfast was included as well. Hotel was full when we stayed there so it was a little bit of a scramble for breakfast with the eating area full BUT they opened up one of the meeting rooms for extra seating.

I saw the evening manager, Autumn, deal with a difficult customer on the telephone, always staying professional, polite and courteous, even when you could hear that the customer was being unreasonable. Kudos to her! The day manager (unfortunately I cannot remember her name but it starts with an ""M"") was also very helpful with my requests. The only thing that I found annoying is that the architectural design seems a little different than other Hampton Inns, primarily plumbing. Perhaps it's because I normally get a room that's on high floors and far from the elevators, but this time I was on a low floor almost across from the elevator foyer. For some reason, any time anyone flushed a toilet above, the sewer pipe would sound like someone was bouncing a can of soup down through the pipe, the sound emanating from a panel in the bathroom between Rooms 207 and 209. Very noticeable in the bathroom, not so bad in bed if you have the bathroom door closed. Otherwise, this property lives up to the standard one would expect with a Hampton Inn and I would definitely stay at this property again.",4,positive

We are regular guests at Hilton hotels and we were not disappointed by our stay at the Hampton Inn. The staff is very friendly and the hotel is very well maintained. I looks new from the lobby to the corridors and into the rooms. We particularly appreciated having a small fridge in the room and a microwave oven. I used both of them to keep some of the left overs from the restaurants we frequented and warm them up the next day. The room was spacious and very comfortable. We had a great rest as the hotel is very quiet, eventhough it seemed to be full. I recommend the Hampton Inn for your stay in Barrie.

Most especially the dinning area........seat were stitched together and extremely dirty and shabby looking.The tables were filthy and I had to clean one before sitting for breakfast....not impressed. The beds are PURE torture..hard as a rock and me with spinal surgery twice it was pure hell to sleep at all. Way too expensive, prices have risen astronomically since the first year it opened and you are getting much less.  Overall the place needs a TRUE makeover. I loved this place and was always comfortable but I am done until they fix it up. I am off to Sheraton Four Points to see how it is.

Stayed in a Suite which provided a Microwave, small fridge sink and 1 cup Coffee maker.  The Pros:   - Fantastic Reception Staff (with special recognition to Autumn) -24 hr coffee/tea with flavour options in Lobby  - Micro/Fridge/Sink and large counter area similar to small galley style kitchen - Seperated sink area from shower and toilet to allow 2 people to get ready at a time (suggest to put shampoo/conditiiner and soap in room with shower. Once in there, there is no way to retrieve them unless you walk into the other room) - Large varieties of options to chose from at Breakfast Buffet (better than most) - Clean - Very comfortable beds - Grocery and Big box Home Hardware stores across street. - On a hill with beautiful view over looking Barrie. I would request a higher floor facing lake to benefit from the view from your room. - Lots of parking spots - Just off of the highway  The Cons  -Eggs at the Buffet. Not actual eggs. Powdered?  -Location is quiet, only restaurant you can walk to is at hotel beside the Hampton. But beleive kitchen closes at 10pm there. - No cutlery, plates, or microwavable dish to use. Bring your own - No dish soap (or dish soap cloth to wash up) Bring your own.   I would recommened this stay for a family or bunch of people that would like a small apartment like stay. Suites can have adjoining rooms so internal room doors can remain open or locked closed. It is nice to know you can have breakfast waiting and fairly good hot coffee/tea to start your day. And come back to heat any leftovers or keep your beverages snacks cold.  You definitely need a car to get around but thats not a bad thing as Barrie is beautiful and has many things to do and see.

Room was clean enough (baseboards, and behind the furniture could use a little attention), staff was super friendly and accommodating. Breakfast was delicious both days, and there were two attendants at all times making sure everything was full & fresh, and the tables were cleaned as soon as they were vacated. The whirlpool was broken, which is not a big deal for us at all, the front-desk attendant told us at check-in and said they were waiting for parts, so it wasn't a surprise when we went down there to use the pool. The pool itself was clean, and not busy at all, which made it nice for the kids. There were no towels on Saturday morning, but plenty on Sunday. Again, not a huge deal, we brought our own anyway. Overall a great experience, and will be my new go-to place to stay when we visit Barrie

It just a place to stay to avoid long drives. Place is clean, room is clean etc.....what warrants the 2 stars is interesting however: There is no fridge in the room, so I do what everyone does, I use the door loop lock to keep the door open and go 5 steps across the hall to get ice. As soon as I get back to the room there is a security guard holding my door open and following me into my room. He explains to me that keeping the door open in this manner is somehow a fire hazard and that the hotel does not allow this practice. I'm a little startled as it is not the norm for anyone to enter a room without being asked, and I felt a little violated. I tell the security guard that there is a metal guard in the door so it looks like it is expected that people will use the loop locks in this fashion, I am told again that it is a fire hazard and no additional information is given as to why an unlocked but closed door would be a fire issue. The security guard hovers in my entrance fiddling with the lock and I tell him it's ok he does not have to stay, I'll clos the door, he keeps standing in my doorway, having to close the door on him slowly so he gets the hint to leave. About a half an hour lat r I am out in the hall again to get more ice (with my key this time) and again I see the security guard right outside my room hovering in the hallway. Later a fe families gathered in a room to quietly watch the end of a baseball game, we here a knock at the door and no one answers, the kids open the door and no one is there, they exit the room to look in the hallway and immediately the security guard is telling the kids they are not allowed in the halls. The guard then enters the room Un-invited and admonishes the adults about the loop lock and tell us there has been a noise complaint. At this point I have had enough of the bogus fire hazard nonesence and the whole entering guest rooms without being invited so I go out in the hall to talk to the guard. I tell him that my child is allowed in the halls to move between rooms as long as he does it in a quiet manner and he has no reason to enter anyone's room un-invited. I told him that we are not drinking, not making any noise and that as guest we should be afforded so,e respect, the guard then tells me that I am being belligerent and that he is going to call the police, all of this when I am just talking to him in a normal voice. Omce hearing this threat, I tell the guard I am a paying guest and I am not trespassing or doing anything wrong and the threat is unwarranted and unacceptable. I tell the guard it is time to go down and talk to the manager, he agrees reluctantly but insists I ride down in the same elevator, I tell him no, I will meet you down there, he insists again and I tell him no, I will be down in a minute (keep in mind there are other adults witnessing the whole hallway conversation). I wait for the guard to go and take the next elevator down. When I get to the lobby, I tell,the manager what is going on, that we feel violated when someone enters our rooms un-announced, that we feel we are being targeted for no reason, that we are paying guest that just want to be left alone. Upon hearing this, the guard protests stating he never told any kids they could not be in the hall, that he never entered anyone's room. The manager told us there was a general noise complaint for our floor but no room number was given as a source, he assured me that we would be left alone. I have been to many hotels for sporting events And I have never been treated in this manner before! This security guard needs to realize that we are customers, amd he needs to treat people with respect, not with threats. We will not be staying in this hotel ever again",2,negative

I love the location of this hotel; set back away from the busy hwy. 400 in a quiet, pleasant area with a beautiful view of the surrounding area from the upper floors. Our room was clean and quiet. The bed and pillows are super comfy and I love the full length mirror in the hallway. As with other Hampton Inns, there is no exhaust fan in the bathroom which causes much steam buildup on the bathroom mirror. Breakfast was wonderful with a wide variety of hot and cold selections. Parking is free and the lot is spacious. The location of the hotel is central so it is very easy to navigate to the surrounding sites. The price of the room was a touch higher than the Mississauga location which I found rather surprising. The price, however, was comparable to other hotels of this caliber. I would highly recommend the Hampton in Barrie.",5,positive

39714395,barrie/ca/154980/1238832/39714395.html,Hampton Inn &amp; Suites by Hilton Barrie,"Our stay here was great until we were leaving. My young daughter forgot her razor and asked for a complimentary one from the front desk. She was provided one but upon opening it, she suspected it was used. She told me and I said ""No way, that would be impossible"" When I checked - for sure - it was used. There were little hairs, dirt and grease all over it. Someone had just popped the little cap back on after using it. I immediately brought it to the attendant at the front desk (Sat. morning), who appeared to be equally horrified and immediately started going through the razors. There were several questionable ones but she searched until she found one that looked really clean. I did not have time to bring it to the manager's attention as I was leaving. I wanted to bring it to the attention of customer service to make sure something like this NEVER happens again. As a healthcare worker, I know that there are health risks of acquiring blood-tranmitted illnesses such as hepatitis B, etc. with used razors. It's a very serious thing. I have learned my lesson - I will never request a razor in any hotel - it's not worth the risk (unless it is properly sealed). Anyhow, I emailed customer service almost two weeks ago. I received a reply informing me that my concern would be addressed in 3 business days. It has now been 9 business days and I emailed them again - no response. Now, I am really frustrated. I don't know if they don't believe me that it happened or they don't think it was a big concern. Either way, it doesn't look as though they are going to address the situation. I have always loved the Hampton Inns because normally we have had really good experiences but I am so disappointed with the Hilton now. They will certainly never again be my first choice!!!!!!",1,negative

Wes, a day manager, at the hotel promptly and kindly adjusts all of my reservations, keeping me in the same room and treating me like Hampton Inn ""royalty"". The cleaning staff allows me the plenty of time around my crazy schedule to make up the room when it works for me and not because I am in or I missed their rotation.   The facilities are truly lovely and well-maintained. The lobby is gorgeous and everyone greets you with a smile and welcoming approach. There's a pay laundry machine in the basement that makes my ""living"" here easy and affordable too. I haven't used the swimming pool in the basement but the other guests, especially all of the wet kids I pass by on the elevator, absolutely adore it.

We called the front desk and they informed that no house keeping is currently available.  Despite the inconvenience, that was not a major issue for us as we understand that these issues can happen. What was really disappointing is the response we got from the manager on duty on Sunday and the house keeping manager. Instead of making a simple apology about the inconvenience caused, they stated that there was a ""do not disturb"" sign on the door which is "" NOT TRUE"". We left the hotel at noon on Saturday and I personally made sure that no sign on the door and when we came back there was no sign on the door either.   So instead of professionally handling the issue by make simple apology, they implied that we were lying.  We typically stay in Hilton brand hotels when we travel as we trust the name and people associated with this chain. The above incident will leave a big dent in our trust in Hampton Inn and Hilton.

My experience travelling with hockey teams, is hotels generally bring out their 'tough' attitude and expect trouble. They watch your every move to ensure no trouble, sometimes where there isn't any. This hotel did quite the opposite. Beverages at the pool are generally met with a 'boot out' attitude. This hotel 'accomodated' us with plastic cups and continued to support us with extra tables, extra chairs etc. They kept all patrons happy including those not in our group. They even gave recommendations on where to eat with a large crowd. One particular incident with a hostile hotel patron (person was being belingerent to our children) was diffused by the hotel staff so that all patrons were happy and minimal disruption. Hats off to their staff. When the room noise was higher at the later hours - they continued to support us and offered a reasonable alternative that again suited all patrons. As always - travelling with a group has its issues, this hotel staff had the foresight to diffuse situations before they became a problem and continued to accomodate even the most difficult travellers.

In terms of service, cleanliness, and layout, this hotel is right up there with the nicest Hiltons. The rooms and lobby are both very nice, spacious, and very well maintained. Though the free breakfast is the standard Hampton Inn items, it is done very well, and the hot items are better than at most other Hampton Inns.  My only complaint is about the pool. The pool room is very nicely laid out, and has a lot of potential, especially since it is the newer style Salt Water pool, that doesn't use chlorine to maintain the water. If they would just turn the temperature up in the pool, it could be this hotels greatest asset. Instead they have it set so cold that it is barely tolerable. Several guests were complaining about this at the pool. I called the front desk to complain and was told that Salt Water Pools much be kept cooler than chlorine pools. I don't think that is true, because I've been in some pretty warm salt water pools before, but even if it is true there is no reason for it to be this could. Without a thermometer, I would guess that it was about 62F. Maybe colder.   When traveling with kids a usable pool is very important.

About ten people also tried to use the pool while we were there and they all got out of the pool because of cold water. It was a Saturday evening and the parking lot was full, so it wasn't the best time to do some cost-cutting on water heating. The pool should be ""cool"", not cold. The room was clean and warm, the motel looks well maintained and the free breakfast offered some good omelet.

The Hampton Inn and Suites was the second place we tried and I wish it would have been our first. The hotel is well laid-out, classy-looking and easy to find. Staff were very pleasant and helpful and the free breakfast was terrific. My husband loved the Western omelettes and I enjoyed making my own homemade waffle. Free hot chocolate, tea and coffee were available 24/7. We stayed in a room with two queen beds and it was very spacious and the beds were quite comfortable.  The best part of all was that despite having three teams and a wedding party staying there we did not get bothered by noise. This is very important to us because when we are travelling we usually have to get up quite early and like to get our sleep. I am sure that if there would have been a problem the staff would've dealt with it because they mentioned that when we first checked in.

It was the size of two rooms for only twenty dollars more. You recieved a pull out sofa bed, a big table for your laptop (free internet), a fridge, microwave and a long counter for misc. stuff you have.  The hotel is great really, just off the highway and Days inn, Zehrs down the road. The only problem we had the entire time was finding a bug in the bed the first night. It freake us out but after thorough inspection we found no others. Sleeping was light since we were bracing for bed bug bites. Thankfully there weren't any in the morning.

There were a few to choose from, but a personal recommendation is always best. Even if she didn't eat there specifically, surely she must know where the hot spots are in town.   We ended up eating at Manhattan's for dinner (it was Barrielicious, too -- so 3 courses for $20!), and it was good. The next day, we had lunch at Shutters, and also took advantage of the $20 Barrielicious menu. The food and service were both excellent. All in all, a great business trip to Barrie.",5,positive

If you have a car, the Hampton Inn is conveniently located near exit 94 (Essa Road) of Highway 400. Coming from Toronto, this would be a little bit before the main downtown area. Bryne Drive appears to be a more recent development with a Days Inn, and a few big box store. The other side of the highway (Fairview road) is where the older hotels (Holiday Inn) are located as well as some eating spots (Tim Horton's, Wendy's, Pizza Hut, Mandarin as well as a Bar&Grill - 10 min. walking distance, 3 min. by car).  The Hampton Inn appears fairly new. Common areas look nice. I believe that I was upgraded to a nice oversize room. Internet (wifi or wired) is complimentary, as is breakfast. Bed was comfortbale andf everything was in working order.   Bathroom was of nice size and an additional sink/mirror was located next to the bathroom and close to the bed. This layout is a bit akward as the bathroom amenities, dryer,... are technically in a separate room than the bathroom. I was happily surprised with the toilettries (shampoo/conditioner). I usually find the stuff in hotel rooms to do a very poor job as it may smell nice, but doesn't clean the hair at all. Not the case there - not sure if it is high quality stuff but at least, it works!!!  The complimentary breakfast is continental style, with a few hot items such as waffles, ""cheezy"" eggs and pork patties. Quality was somewhat above average for a complimentary breakfast.  Another surprise was the gym area, which featured a ""full-size Precor fitness center, up to the regular Hilton standard"". The gym features 2 treadmills, one elliptical, bikes and some musculation equipment. The hotel also have a decent size pool.  A laundry room is also available on-site",5,positive

We stayed while going to a concert at Casino Rama that evening. About a 40 min drive to Rama from here which is a bit long, however hotel choices nearer are limited and costlier.   We were welcomed back as repeat customers and checked in quickly . We had booked a Queen Suite as we were travelling with our adult daughter. We were all surprised by how large this suite was !! Normally photos provided by the hotel tend to exagerate a room's size, but this time they did not do it justice. I wont describe it as you can look at the website. The room was very clean and very up to date decor. (very new location) . As we are Honours Club members they had provide bottled water and microwave popcorn (room has fridge,micro and wet bar area) The only odd part of the room layout is that they have separated the tub/shower/toilet from the sink/vanity. So you are basically brushing your teeth looking out into the bedroom/sitting area. Thats ok but I am a early riser and if you are trying to move around quietly you dont want to use the sink. Just a observation , nothing more.   Very good complimentary breakfast in morning. Lots of choices!! Omelets/make your own fresh waffles etc. Two very busy,efficient young ladies keeping things full and tidy.  Check-out easy as bill slipped under door for verification and away you go.

We came across Barr's Motel shortly after turning off the 400. It wasn't the greatest looking place from the outside, but the price was right ($63 tax included). I should have started to worry when I noticed a sign attached to the front desk that stated several different times (in bold capitalized letters) that there were absolutely no refunds once you give them your credit card - no matter what. But it was past midnight and we were both exhausted, so we took our chances. Bad idea. My husband and I found our room (which was an adventure since the majority of the room numbers had fallen off the doors), and were greeted by a tiny, dirty room, with several resident spiders. The floor was disgusting, there were stains on the walls, cobwebs in the closet, and the bathroom was filthy. The shower (if you can call it that) was literally a little hole-in-the wall located behind the bathroom door (we didn't even notice it until one of us went to the bathroom and closed the door), and was so dirty that we both opted to drive home the next day un-showered, rather than step foot in it. We both slept fully clothed on top of the sheets, and had an extremely restless night due to the taxis coming in and out at all hours of the night, and the noises coming from the other rooms through the paper thin walls - we could not only hear people in the room adjacent to us, but those who were staying in rooms 2 or 3 over. The fact that the door lock was very flimsy too, and pretty much useless, didn't help us feel at ease either. We finally decided there was no point in pretending to sleep any longer, and got up shortly after the sun did. As we were getting in our car, a woman (whose attire left little to the imagination) came out of a room a few doors down and asked if she could catch a ride across town. That was the last nail in the coffin of the Barr's Motel. We will never stay there again, and recommended you do the same. There's a Comfort Inn just down the street. Pay the extra $ and stay there.",1,negative

The beds were clean and the manager was a very nice women, who tried her best to make our stay more comfortable.There are no non-smoking rooms, but the manager provided us with a Rain Wave, which helped clear the room from the smell of smoke.There were people sitting around, and smoking just outside of our door. The ABSOLUTE WORST experience we had in this motel, was finding blood all over the side of the telephone and receiver.A lot of blood! There was also blood splatter on the bathroom wall, behind the door. When my husband ran to the wash-room to grab the toilet paper roll, it had blood all over the toilet paper and the roll too! It was at that time, we were informed that they were having problems with crack heads sneaking around and breaking into rooms. ie.the room we were in! We cleaned up all the blood with soap and water and then I went to WalMart to purchase disinfectant spray.I sprayed every surface in the room, bathroom and the beds. We nearly choked to death with the combination of the disinfectant spray and the cigarette smoke from motel guests who were smoking while standing in the doorways of their rooms. Very unsavoury clientèle and so we slept with a chair wedged under the door knob!

The price seemed a bit low and we were shown the room before renting. The room itself looked clean. The hotel was small seemed like it only had a few rooms. The women told us it was the last room available. We were told the room was non smoking which seems to contridict the comment of another reviewer on here. Once we were in the room it became apparent that the neighbouring rooms if not all the other rooms were long term guests. During the night taxi cabs with passengers kept coming and banging loadly on several of the other doors, leaving the cabs outside running. Was a very sleepless night. Not sure if this was a crack house but it sure looked like it with the amount of traffic coming to those doors at all hours of the night. Best bet is to stay somewhere else. We won't be staying here again. Likely the last time we will stay in barrie it was that bad of an experience for us. We didnt feel safe as mentioned by other reviews and were worry our motorcycle was going to be missing by morning.

I have never been so appauled by the lack of responsibliity two individuals have, they literally made me feel as if I were bothering them by coming in. They were nothing but rude and all they cared about was money. We were up all night because of the noise from the rooms beside us we could hear drug deals going on and people having sex in the opposite room. It was disgusting. I truly hope that nobody has this unfortunate time like we did go stay at the other places in Barrie. We always have stayed at the Travelodge on Bayfield and will gladly be going back there and never risking a dive like this again. There is a great gal over there a red head by the name of Lee or Lisa she is super amazing and will treat you like gold.",1,negative

The other people that are staying at this place are positively scary.

That being said my experience at this place was positively frightening. I was awakened at 4 AM buy some loogan and pounding on the door of the room next to me begging for his crackhead girlfriend to let him back in.I wanted to leave the place the and there but the Lugin was outside and I didn't want to cross his path. Nobody should be frightened to stay in a place. My advice, never stay here keep driving even if you're sleepy pulled to the side of the road it will be a better night sleep for you.

When they get big... lookout large chains because they up the bar!! We got there after suppertime and they knew who we were! They accommodated us by making sure we had a ground level room with a window from which we could keep an eye on our motorcycles. Beautiful foyer/entrance, friendly staff and noticeably clean hotel compared to many. Room had two queen beds, 1 flat screen tv, a coffee maker, fridge and was very clean! Unfortunately, as is the trend now, each bed has about 5 pillows none of which are thin enough to properly rest your head and not break your neck. I slept without a pillow, as I often do in hotels. Continental breakfast is included and is very nice. They have good control over who walks in but you can't get a coffee to go (I didn't want to wake my friend so i didn't make coffee in the room). Please show some flexibility when I've shown you my breakfast ticket and explained I did not want to wake my friend; let me have a coffee so I can go sit outside with it! I had one in the restaurant anyways. This would be the only ""gripe"" I'd have but it isn't one because the staff there was wonderful as well(they were following rules... with a smile). Everyone says good morning and they all smile - must be a great place to work! The pool area could have private showering facilities but what is there works. Business office is perfect and complimentary for guests! Take note big hotel chains! Did not use the spa so couldn't comment.

Our room was immaculate when we went in, and very plush and inviting. The suites include everything you could ask for, two tv, microwave, coffee maker, fridge, safe, fireplace, two nice chairs and table, comfy bed. The salt water pool is nice, however a little small for our liking. The fitness room although small as well, was great. Everything was in excellent working condition. The restaurant there is not very big so a good idea to go early for breakfast, but the food quality at breakfast is very good there. We had a five minute wait for a table, which was great. We had the deluxe continental breakfast and it was excellent. We had the smallest suite called the Sunrise suite and it is the smallest suite they offer, but it was large enough and very nice. Quite ample for a couple. Our room overlooked the 400 highway and it was noisy at night, however we left the jacuzzi fan on to block out the noise. Also some ladies came in at three am and were yelling and screaming, woke me up from a peaceful sleep, so I called front desk and they went immediately and dealt with the situation. So very good service that way. There are shears and drapes in the room, but the drapes are only decorative and you can't pull them to shut off the light from outside. Now that didn't bother us too much, but I have heard others talk about that as well. They might benefit from putting some drapes on that do pull shut. We purchased the Strawberry and fine wine special that included the hot breakfast, and we felt that was very good value. We would definitely recommend this hotel to others and hope to return again sometime in the near future.

Had the Romeo and Juliet Suite which was two stories. Room was spotless. Microwave, fridge, coffee maker. Large jacuzzi in the corner, separate bathroom, couch, chairs, desk, fireplace and tv, then upstairs another fireplace, tv with a king size bed. The bed is very comfortable. Linens smelled fresh. T V reception good. Free wifi. Jacuzzi easily fit two people. Never heard any noise from other rooms, the hall or the hwy. Had the wine with chocolate covered strawberries delivered to the room. All very good but the presentation was lacking as it came on a cafeteria style tray and the wine was in a plastic ice bucket (the kind you find in the room) Simple upgrade to a clear acrylic tray and wine bucket would have made it look more appetizing although the strawberries were fresh.  Never used the pool but it did look quite small.  Had dinner in the restaurant and it was excellent. (Veal Marsella) Decent price, had a $60 credit towards dinner and 2 entrees, 3 appetizers and 3 drinks only cost us $23 more plus tip. Breakfast (upgraded) was included. There was lots of food but cut-up fruit would have been nice. The only fruit was banana, apple and oranges which were just placed in a bowl. There was cookies, muffins, pastries, bagels, english muffins, toast, cereal, yogurt, juice, coffee, tea. No meat or eggs unless you had the upgrade.  As other people have commented, there is really no where to walk around the hotel. All in all I would definately recommend this hotel.

130077054,barrie/ca/154980/1488634/130077054.html,Monte Carlo Inn - Barrie Suites,"we have stayed there many times, dined in the restaurant too and have throughly enjoyed it , with the exception of a couple of flaws that at times may be pointless like the curtain no heavy drapes ok if you like bright sunlight in the morning. Once when we checked in more recently , there seemed to be some confusion with hotel managers and front office staff being repremanded that we heard from around the corner, not sure what that was all about . houwever the foodin the dining room , the take pride in what they do and are most welcoming for a hotel restaurant. Simple , but tasty and just plain and simple good food with a creative flare , the chocolate salmon is delicious , and the lemon shortcake yummy. breakfast is a well run affair although i noticed a little different set up which seems a little confusing and awkward for guests and staff to move around as the space is smaller for a dining room but feasable for the hotel size . Being a previous visitor I found this visit breakfast seemed a little awkward as I said before , but none the less it was good and comparable when you think that some places you would pay $10 bucks for the same items at another hotel in Barrie. We always get the breakfast upgrade as well great deal for $3.95 cheapest breakfast in town!!!! I love the place its clean and the staff are all friendly . One other thing is the hotel is only 3 years old and their is one lady at the front office that is not as pleasant as the other young ladies but we can all have a bad day I guess, will be back!!!!!",5,positive

It is an easy off and on the 400. Lots of parking, friendly staff and nice clean rooms. They have a little restaurant downstairs for room service and breakfast and the food is pretty good. The hotel is very clean, and they are accommodating. There is a fridge and microwave in the room. If you choose a suite - it is larger than the regular room and not that much more expensive. If I was in Barrie again - I would stay at this hotel.
 
 
 Room Tip:  I would order the suite to have more space. Rooms facing the 400 - can be noisy.

I do not like that they put a hold on your visa for any damage and incidentals. Other hotels take your card but don't put a hold on it. We needed a room since I was running the Barrie Half Marathon the following morning bright and early. The hotel gives you free breakfast but we didn't use it since we were out the door at 7am and just came back right before check out to clean up and pack. Again we didn't use any amenities since we weren't there long. But the room is a good size and clean, what more do you need for a quick stop over!

Tonight both staff on duty was amazing polite And always greeting everyone.   The only Thing i heard that kinda of caught my attention was that the guest services were telling to another client during check in that the ""4th floors were higher qualities"" basically the best in the house. Not sure why we were stuck in the 1st.   But over good just for a quick stay.   Ps. The wireless Internet as advertised goes in and out sometimes.

Great location to get to where you want to go and it was about a 35 minute ride to the Orillia. The room was very clean but the only dissatisfaction was the blanket on the bed had stains on it otherwise the bed was very comfortable and the bedding was clean. The bathroom was also very clean. Did not have use for the pool or gym they were small but functional. The free breakfast was fresh and very good but for a very small price you could upgrade to a hot breakfast. The front desk staff and restaurant staff were all very friendly and helpful. Overall it was a good experience and I would stay at the Monte Carlo Inn again. Mary Anne S.,4,positive
134230693,barrie/ca/154980/1488634/134230693.html,Monte Carlo Inn - Barrie Suites,"We came to Barrie for a three night anniversary getaway, as we wanted to tour the Georgian Bay area a little farther north. I researched through tripadvisor and decided that this hotel was a good location, and had the best value for the kind of room we wanted. We reserved a Renaissance king suite. The room has a king bed with a glass divider, separating the bed from a living room area.   The room is about a third larger than a standard room, and we enjoyed the extra space, as well as the sitting area. The hotel has both wifi and ethernet, and we like the ethernet for faster speeds, and that is a big plus for us.The room has a fridge and microwave, which are good features.  The bathroom, while a bit on the small side, was clean and modern. The bed is comfortable.  The front desk staff was accommodating and pleasant. The indoor salt water pool was relaxing.  The free continental breakfast was ordinary but adequate. You can upgrade to a hot breakfast for $3.95. I did enjoy the cereal with bananas and a bagel, so I was fine without a hot breakfast. We also dined in the restaurant one evening, and while we enjoyed our meal, we felt that the restaurant would have more patrons if they changed their concept to a little less expensive menu. If you are from the states as we are.. don't even bother with cocktails, as Canadian law requires exactly one shot.. even doubles seemed weak to us and at high prices to boot. We are not alcoholics, but we do like a nice drink ... so BYOB for your hotel room.  The TV was fine except we would recommend having it mounted so it can swerve to change positions for where you are watching. Also, a paper channel guide would be helpful, as the screen channel guide only showed four channels at a time.  The only other issue is that the AC unit was right by the bed. While this did not bother me, it may bother some guests. I put it on fan mode instead of auto mode so it would be constant, rather than stop and go.  I absolutely recommend this hotel. It was quiet and relaxing, with nice patrons and staff. If we come here for another getaway, we will stay again.",4,positive

The one thing that I do have to complain about is the restaurant. We had the romance package and we were getting chocolate dipped strawberry's and champagne. Our champagne cam in two dirty glasses with cellophane on them the strawberries were ok. Secondly we had ordered bruschetta from them and it was terrible! We got four little tiny pieces of bread with something that resembled tomatoes and herbs. It didn't taste very good either. You had a continental breakfast that was complimentary but it wasn't enough so we ordered breakfast that was not good either and WAY over priced. I was very disappointed since we were so excited to go to the hotel and have a great weekend away. The rooms our beautiful and I would definitely recommend the hotel just not to eat there.,4,positive

After the restaurant the room service person brought up our wine and strawberries and we enjoyed the jacuzzi tub in the spacious room. The hotel looks very new still and they do a very good job with cleanliness. At check out the woman at the desk said ""happy anniversary"" and we would definitly return next year.

I mentioned this was our wedding day and we would be busy and if we did not check in until after midnight would this be a problem. It was quoted to me that ""No problem, its not our policy to give our rooms away"" Well when we showed up just after 1am, they informed us they were trying to reach us, and which I informed I really dont have any where to hold my phone (bride) and we were a little busy. I asked why were you trying to reach us and I already called earlier in the week and to prearrange the groom and I booked this room in February'12 ( we got married July 21'12) He said we tried to preapprove your credit card and we didnt know if you were showing up. I mentioned I had called earlier in week and tried to make arrangements and nothing was mentioned then about preapproving and why didnt she do it then.

This was very disappointing as the ""buffet"" consisted of stale pastries, although we were offered a hot breakfast for another $4.

As locations go, it looks like all the hotels are on this same stretch of road so while it isn't ideally located if you don't have a car, it isn't unique to this hotel.

Through it all, however, the clerk was pleasant and tried to be helpful. The room itself was quite nice. It was clean, the bedding comfortable, and the building (and room) seemed quite well insulated against noise. The cost of the room was a little less than we might have paid at another chain. (I do suspect that they may be achieving their lower prices by making do with fewer cleaning staff, leading to rooms being ready late.) Breakfast was adequate.

My room was well-appointed and there were no signs of wear - the bathroom's condition was as if the hotel had opened last month. I enjoyed the friendly, helpful interaction with the front desk people and we all had some fun when I locked myself out of my room as I was loading and unloading study materials from my car. As I was paying my compliments to the front office staff, I was given a copy of the Monte Carlo Inns corporate brochure - I've decided to join their incentive program and I'm going to check out their other properties which are conveniently located in several of my other business destinations.

We did NOT enjoy our stay at all. We recieved a call at 10:17 pm telling us to tone down. I do admit, we did have music playing since we were heading out but it was NOT overly loud. It's not my first stay in a motel. As we were heading out at 11:00 pm the front desk clerk told us to not talk as we were walking out.   We got back to the motel at approx 230am. As we were walking into the room (our room was on the 1st floor, closest to the front desk) the phone was rigning. Once again...it was the front desk and again we were told to stop talkin and tone it down. If we didn't, our deposit would not be returned. Again, we were not loud, we were not yelling, we were not running around ect. WAY TOO STRICT and front desk is rude  Another downfall is breakfast...u have to pay extra for certain things.

Impressed with the cleanliness of the halls, and the friendliness of the check in staff. Nice touch to have infused lemon water available right at reception. Our room was the Cleopatra suite room 421 on the 4th floor.. On walking into the room it was wonderfully bright and sunny as on a corner- so lots of windows facing west and north.Pleased to have a small fridge and the use of a microwave.The bed is king size and very comfortable. I suggest you bring towels as they are very thin and unacceptable. Having watched a documentary on hotels we now keep cheapo slippers to wear and we bring our own disinfectant wiping down various well used surfaces.Don't get me wrong the room was spotless-it's just that this documentary made hotel rooms appear to be breeding grounds for germs and it spooked us. Well at the centre of the room there are 4 huge pillars-- mirror ceiling and the jacuzzi taking centre stage. They have amenities to use in the tub.There is an electric fireplace and 2 comfortable chairs. The room was very large and we felt worth the $200 for the night. Great that they have room service with good prices and also an onsite restaurant and bar. Small but great looking pool. You really don't have to go out as they have pretty much everything there. We would return.

Im sorry he shouldve arranged to have them moved. The next morning I had an extra $60 dollar charge on my card that I didn't authorize and sign for!....Thats Ilegal! And to top it all off she said ""there was nothing we can do because matthew went home for shift."" Thats not how a hotel operates bussiness by frauding peoples credit cards! Monte carlo should be a reputable hotel chain, not after today, employees like matthew paul are destroying the reputation of the company, home office should really address this employee if they want to keep their hotel chain!..",1,negative

We started the night by having dinner at the hotels restaurant, it was expensive but was worth it for the scenery, romantic music playing and we had the restaurant to ourselves! The food was delicious too, I can't remember what it was called but I had the pasta with shrimp, very very yummy and filling. After eating at the restaurant we went up to our hotel room. We had booked had a big king sized bed, Jacuzzi, and fireplace. It was very romantic and beautiful. The room looked very organized and clean. The only downside to the room we had was the streetlights outside were right next to our windows, but they have thick blinds to block it out. I would defiantly recommend this to anyone who wants a relaxing stay. We will be going again soon!",5,positive

We have stayed here half a dozen times in the last year for various outings.  We usually stay in the rooms that have the jacuzzi tub and a fireplace in the room. (adds to the atmophere). It is located in an area of Barrie that has a lot of good restaurants around and a taxi to diner is not too expensive.  The ""free"" breakfast is nothing to write home to Mom about. It's free so who am I to complain about it but don't get your hopes up to much. For a few extra bucks you can upgrade and get eggs and meat but again it's not really worth it. Grab the free coffee and some toast and head to Cora's down the street for a fabulous breakfast.  You should try this place the rooms are fantastic and it is very reasonably priced

The pictures on the website are not there real deal. The rooms are not big at all, and the bed I order was a queen and was told it was but there was no way that bed was a queen, it was a double if not a full.

They have roomservice available but you can't just order a drink you have to order food with it.

Service at the restaurant was good but the food was not the best. Breakfast was a chore because the restaurant is grossly undersized so you are either waiting in line or fighting your way to the juice machine. When we checked in we were told by the people at the front desk that we were getting breakfast vouchers. In my experience you usually get breakfast vouchers when you get the upgraded breakfast but this was not the case. The breakfast voucher is for the continental breakfast. The elevator was incredibly slowwww! I used the elevator once or twice and then opted to use the stairs even though I was on the 4th floor. The walls do not muffle sound at all! The people next door were partying and running from room to room slamming doors. Some girls were drunk and sitting on the floor and talking very loudly. We made two calls to the front desk and even asked the people to be quiet. It wasn't until 3 am that the noise and the slamming doors stopped but we still had to put up with the neighbour's loud TV. The next morning I complained at the front desk they told me they would speak to the manager about this... now what does that mean? Apparently it means nothing because I checked out and they never apologized for letting this go on and they did not compensate me in any way.  We won't be back!,1,negative

I went to close the drapes and was caught in a strong smell of smoke - called front to say someone had been smoking there (thinking to avoid cleaning costs if we were blamed). Staff changed us to another room - explaining that the room had changed from a smoking room on Jan 1 - but ""It has been cleaned"". We were transferred to room 101 which was clean, BUT, there was noise from the Supervisors room next door till 4 a.m. which started up again at 6 a.m.  Maybe we'll try somewhere else on our next trip to Barrie.

Barrie has lots of weekend sporting events with hockey, skating, dance, volleyball to name a few and I was expecting to have a hotel full of crazy loud teams. Not this time, maybe Monte Carlo has strict policies on teams.  My room was new, the hotel is only a few years old, the temperature was good and I didn't have to adjust it. The bed was on the softer side and comfortable. The pillows were very puffy. They use comforter and sheet so you're not able to take off the bedspread if you're squeamish about that. There was a perfume spray odor, seems common in hotels these days. The room was quiet, although there was a fan in the hall that circulated all night that acted as white noise. It was more apparent in the morning. Flat screen TV with a working remote, microwave and fridge. No problems with people noise from hallway or other rooms, or bathrooms.  The WIFI is spotty, they could improve on this, and perhaps due to having a full hotel? I did not use the pool although it is right by the lobby and looked appealing and clean. I did not use the restaurant having to get up very early the next morning to go. I would have appreciated the inroom coffee to have takeaway cups.  Front desk was kind and polite and took their time with guests. Check in was slow on a Friday night with just one clerk working. They could have an extra staff at this peak time.   The parking lot needed a bit more plowing but there were enough spaces.

The noise made for a very restless sleep. In the morning we noticed a strong cigarette smell when we opened the curtains. The carpet was damaged with cigarette burns. I reported the issues when we checked out. The front desk explained that they converted to non-smoking so it takes time for the smell to leave. The front desk also said they knew about the HVAC issue and that it was a ""city"" requirement. Question...why then would management rent out a less than satisfactory room especially when they knew it had potential health issues? The advertised free breakfast is actually a free continental breakfast. It will cost you $4 per person if you want more than bruised fruit, stale pastries and bad coffee. Very disappointed

We were going to Rama for a concert and our two regular choices for hotels were sold out. We normally stay at the Best Westerns as they have a shuttle to and from the Casino. We decided to take a chance on finding a place to stay in Barrie. First of all, it needs to be said that we have never stayed at a cleaner more well cared for hotel. It was remarkable - our room, the halls, the ice machine area; one area as clean as the next. It didn't hurt that we were out of the parking lot and in Barrie by the time the Best Western shuttle would have had us back to their hotel in Orillia! When we checked out in the morning, our attendant Judy was delightful, professional and simply left you with a smile. Even the attendant on duty upon our return from the concert at 11pm had a wave and a smile for us. Upon inquiry, turns out Brenda is the gal who ensures the hotel is as clean as it is. Let's just say she doesn't miss a thing and she does a fabulous job. It is now officially our new go-to place when we go up to Orillia for a concert or for any other reason we can think of to stay there.

Noise all night, all morning long....so absolutely NO SLEEP. Unbelievable that we had the ""BEST"" room. $200 wasted.

We took advantage of the free continental breakfast, and struggled to get my mother-in-law's wheel chair into the small restaurant. The staff was no where to be seen and offered no help. The Guests at the next table assisted us moving our table to make it more accessible. We also had a baby at our table and we had to hunt down a booster seat and strap it onto a chair ourselves.

Did not make much use of the hotel amenities, however from what I could see it was very nicely done. The salt water pool, not very big, but did look nice to relax in. The room was abit small, but the bed was comfortable, the pillows plenty. The bathroom was nice, deep bathtub, not overly long, but was deep. I ended up missing out on the complimentary breakfast, but it did smell wonderful as I walked through the hallways. The staff were wonderful, checking in and checking out were super easy.  I would stay here again.",4,positive

176095236,barrie/ca/154980/1488634/176095236.html,Monte Carlo Inn - Barrie Suites,"Picked this hotel for an overnight golf tourney. Very clean & comfortable. Excellent, friendly staff - front desk, restaurant & housekeepers. We were lucky to be able to check in earlier & again the staff did there best above & beyond to make it possible - thank you! There is bodywash & body lotion provided but no shampoo (I need a certain shampoo anyhow & always bring my own regardless) - so take note. Yes, the curtains didn't close, but I always carry a couple safety pins with me, so we used them to clip them together & did the trick of darkening the room. I had lunch @ the restaurant - tomato/cheddar melt with a spinach soup (comes with choice of fries, salad or soup), $11, not a bad deal & it was delicious! The included breakfast was equally good - bagels, toast, muffins, cookies etc. - what more do you want for a quick start to the day? And for $3.95 you can order bacon & eggs, which is very reasonable - so don't be cheap if you want more than what's included. I too was surprised how quiet it was considering the highway is right there - bonus! I would recommend staying here.

It’s actually a small convention center. Nicer than average rooms. Breakfast was a coupon to the restaurant buffet which was about on par with typical midscale free breakfasts. For a little extra you could order a hot breakfast. Staff was courteous, easy access, plenty of parking, small pool inside. Really short drive to restaurants etc. but not really walkable. I would definitely stay here again. I can’t imagine a much nicer place for the general price range.

First of all kids will be kids. But the hotel should notify people of such a booking and possibly make arrangements to have other patrons on a separate floor. I met with others who were spread across the hotel complaining of the same issues. Children were running up and down the always knocking on doors, shouting and exhausting the elevator. We were woken between 6 630 Sat morning after a very late night event by children playing hockey in the hallway with ice cubes, by the way were are the parents? question asked by many, When later discussing this with front desk she acknowledge the issue stating that it was worst a week ago but no form of compensation offered, We had booked this room in order to be able to attend a late night event with hopes of sleeping in but were unfortunately woken three and a half hrs, later,",3,negative

What is not the same is our room was tiny, about half the size of the same priced room over at holiday inn express (room #101 which barely fits a bed), and the 'free breakfast' is a 'continental breakfast' which consists of apples, toast, peanut butter and coffee. If you want a hot breakfast, you have to Pay $3.95 for an 'upgrade'. We had to leave a security deposit over and above the check in charge and one person brought a tim hortons cup to breakfast and was asked to leave. The room was tiny but the bed & pillows was nice and i admit i had a nice sleep however it just seems that Everything about this hotel was just a bit backwards and defensive, with threats to charge the customers at any excuse possible. Won't be staying here again unless there is No other choice. The location is good, near downtown barrie, just off the highway, easily accessible.
 
 
 Room Tip:  Stay at Holiday inn Express instead if possible.

It is not well laid out and it was hard to find the front entrance from the road. The room was tiny with 2 queen beds and a small tv/table/bedside table. There was very little lighting available in the room. Nice bathtub. The pool was small, the cramped gym was tucked way out of the way..not a safe place for people so I did not use it. The breakfast room was squishy, and we had a terrible first morning breakfast due to the fact the couples took up all the tables for 4 and one could not move tables of 2 together to make a table for a family. There was only 1 staff member in the restaurant and she was run off her feet. The breakfast food was fine.  The room was priced okay due to the fact I used a bidding system to purchase my room. We had to leave a security deposit of $100 in case there was any damage of any kind which was annoying.  I like to book 4star hotels but since our budget was tight over the Christmas holidays we chose something more frugal. I won't choose this inn again.",2,negative

We booked through a third party site and got a king room with their continental breakfast for 85 taxes incl. Check in was easy, they did require a 100 refundable deposit, but the clerk seemee ro rush us through without any general care. It was more mechanical. The room was an ok size, smaller than the usual holiday inn or travelodge but had fridge, microwave coffee maker. The pillows and bedding were fine but the mattress was hard on the oitside and softer once you got it. Room was warm even with the fan on all night at 65. Bathroom was clean but the tub must have been 24inches high to step into without a grab bar. I have never scene one so big. The complementary shampoo and lotion seem to come in refillable containers which is economical but untrustworthy. Their free breakfast was typical of some fruit, beverages, breads, cereals and some store bought pastries. They were stale. The pool is salt water and was small but did the trick for us since it was empty when we went in. Check out was easy and was warmer than check in. Overall for the value it was good but comparable to the days inn or quality inn or a travelodge. 2.5 stars Pete Owen Sound Ontario",3,negative

There was free lemonaid by the elevator which was nice and tasty.   We needed a wine opener at one point and were unable to borrow one from the hotel. Very shocking to stay in a hotel that claims to not have a wine opener for their guests to use.   I looked in on the pool but did not use it. There was plenty of laughter from it the morning of checkout, so someone was enjoying it.   Did not partake in the breakfast because I wasn't hungry, so I can't comment on it.   Still so weird about the wine opener! I've stayed in many hotels and have never been told that ""we don't have use for them"" so they have zero on site for guest convenience.   The closet had a lot of space and the safe is always a nice touch.   I have nothing else negative to say, but I also can't think of anything really good to comment on. It was all pretty average-- nothing overly special or nice to convince people that it's a great place, and nothing really bad, either. It was just ok and average.",3,negative

202053915,barrie/ca/154980/1488634/202053915.html,Monte Carlo Inn - Barrie Suites,"We enjoyed our stay here. The room was not as spacious as some other hotels but was fine for what we needed. The bed was comfortable and we each had 2 pillows. There was an in-room safe, a microwave, mini fridge, flat screen tv (cable and rental movies), work desk and 2 small chairs (that would not have been comfortable to sit in for long periods). The bathroom had a deep tub. My only complaint about the room was that the bathroom fan is on the same switch as the light and the fan is quite noisy. suggest you bring a night light for night bathroom excursions. Also, all the light bulbs are compact fluorescent and quite bright. The room and the hotel were very neat and clean. The décor was current, bright, warm and welcoming. There is a small swimming pool which we did not use due to the presence of screaming children. There is an in-house restaurant which we didn't use except for breakfast. Regarding the complimentary breakfast: you need to pick up ""free breakfast"" cards from the front desk. The restaurant is privately owned as does not allow any outside food or drink so leave your ""Timmie's"" coffee behind. The complimentary breakfast is VERY basic and the yogurt is terrible! You can purchase a regular breakfast for $3.95. The server was very courteous. We will stay there again.

Didn't know what to expect but thought it looked decent online.  Overall, not a bad little Inn. Rooms were a bit small, but not overly. Bathroom was on the smaller side too, but for an overnight stay, no big deal. We just needed a place to lay our heads and for that purpose, it was perfect.   Beds were a bit on the hard side (for me anyways) can't say it was the greatest night sleep I have ever had, that's for sure. My GF however said it didn't bother her in the least.  The only thing I would mention is that it appeared that the police were there investigating a car break in at the back of the parking lot. We saw a smashed rear window on a truck, so the area may be a little sketchy. We decided to park right near the front entrance to discourage anyone from doing the same to us.

The bathroom was extremely clean as well. I have dietary issues so I loved the convenience of making a trip to the local grocery store for a meal and being able to purchase and store my breakfast in my room as well. The only thing I would suggest is to bring your own shampoo and conditioner and soap as I have never had my skin or hair so dry after using the complimentary product. Smelled nice but not so great when you use them. I would highly recommend and would gladly stay here again. Complimentary breakfast is served in the restaurant as part of your stay.

The staff at the front desk were friendly and helpful. Any problems we had, they immediately fixed it. The rates we booked at were more than reasonable.  The room was very clean. It looks like this place was recently renovated and they installed a new HDTV display just before we checked in that day. The wireless internet's speed was more than reasonable for a hotel. In my experience, the internet speed is a hit and a miss at many hotels we've stayed at. But this one was good.  The breakfast was decent, and what we expected. 3 types of cold cereals, orange juice, apple juice, muffins, 3 types of bagels, white bread, whole wheat bread, english muffins, a few types of yogourts, a few types of cookies, croissants, and more. No hot items though, you have to pay extra for that.  The breakfast was good, but I would had liked some hot items to be included. For instance, bacon, eggs, hash brown, etc. I think they are more than reasonable additions at no extra charge for the breakfast vouchers. They could invest in a better mattress though, it was okay but it's a bit too bouncy for my liking.  Overall, I would stay at this place again.",4,positive

All carb, no decaf, no room to 'make your own"" breakfast, crowded seating. The bathroom light was shorting out, not good when in the shower to find yourself in a pitch black unfamiliar room. Again, front desk was told, again nothing was done.Upon arrival, the room smelt like stale cigarette smoke. Told front desk. They suggested we complain formally but were not told how or who to complain to. Our cards deactivated after the first night. The second day we had no face cloths, not even one!

From the moment we checked in front desk staff was cold and acting like it was bothersome for us to be there. Just so you are aware I have sent the same information to the sales manager who booked our team' stay and have received no response. Rooms were nice 1) Breakfast was a joke- one father on our team brought his ticket down and told the staff he was just grabbing a coffee and then going upstairs to grab his daughter and would be down to eat. He was told it was 1 trip only, if he got a coffee and left he could not come back for breakfast. She would not budge on this, another person in the breakfast area said if I make my plate of food and get up to go out to the washroom can I not come back in to eat and she said no it's one trip only  2) we asked the front staff if there was a small room we could use to eat our lunch together as a team. She said no, I said we were willing to pay to use it, she said no because you have to use our caterer. I asked if we could sit out at the 3-4 patio tables outside, she again said no. I assured her I would supervise and clean and was told she would check. She again said no I asked if it was part of the restaurant and she said no. We would up eating our lunch in the hallway as a team.  3) the elevator was very slow and was making a large clunking sound and the door would take forever to open. 10 of our girls got stuck in the elevator. When they pushed the emergency call button it rang the front desk whose response to them was thanks for telling me. She never called anyone or did anything. They called again and she again said thanks. The girls called a father from the team who was a firefighter, he had to tell the front desk to call elevator company and eventual the fire department had to come. After 30 minuted they were rescued, never once did anyone from the hotel come down to check on them being stuck or say one thing to us about this. It was ignored.  4) at 9:30 a group of parents were talking in hallway we were asked to close our doors and be quiet. At 3:30am wedding party guests slamming doors, screaming at top of lungs, running in hallways never addressed.  I get that often times hotels may view having teams stay as bothersome then don't quote us and accept us to stay if you are going to give us subpar lack of customer service and act like we are inconviencing you. We are returning to Barrie next month but will find alternative hotel arrangements as I feel we can find better.",3,negative

I will say that with tears in my eyes I was never so amazed by kindness as I was at that momment. For two nights we were able to gather ourselves together and be ready to face the days ahead. The home away from home saying is so true when you stay here. All the staff are incredible, the rooms are clean and the beds are like sleeping on clouds! We are still here and although I can't wait to go home, I will miss our time at The Monte Carlo Inn. Thank you to all the staff and Management, from the Beauchamps.",5,positive

Greeted at front desk in a more business manner then friendly one. Didn't bother to ask if first time here which it was. Breakfast required a trip back to the front desk in the morning for vouchers. Room was advertised as a suite. Small compared to other hotels for similar money. Room was clean as was bathroom. A little noisy early am on first floor. Overall a reasonable place to stay for one night. Internet was only fair to poor connection. Breakfast was meger at best. No hot food unless you paid an additional 4.99 for bacon and eggs. Overall would not stay here again with the Best western and others nearby for similar money.,3,negative

My husband enjoyed a hot breakfast at an extra cost the next morning. Not all hotels have that option. Most of the time it's only the continental breakfast bar.

That worked out well as we could not have stayed another night! The exterior and the lobby looked fine and the front desk staff were very friendly. We checked in and were told we had been upgraded to a spa room. Very nice except I have major back problems and could not get in to a spa bath if my life depended on it but OK. We give our credit card number and are given our keys to a room on the third floor and THEN are told that the elevator isn't working. Maybe the staff were just carrying out instructions from management but I did not think this was a professional way to handle the problem. I would not have made a booking in a hotel with no elevator so we should have been told before we checked. There is no way that I can make it up and down three flights of stairs so they find us a room on the 2nd floor that will be ready soon if we want to wait in the bar. We agree to do that and the check-in clerk says she will come and let us know as soon as the room is ready. About 45 minutes later we go up to the desk to see if our room is ready and she has left for the day and didn't let her co-worker know we were waiting in the bar! He carried our luggage up to the room which we appreciated. The room was spacious but the spa bath was in the room instead of the bathroom which we found strange. The bathroom light switch automatically turned on the fan which sounded like a jet engine warming up so I found myself groping around in the bathroom in the dark in the middle of the night so I didn't wake my husband up. One set of windows only had sheer curtains so I had the street light outside beaming in on me all night. The room was sweltering when we arrived but, much as we tried to follow the instructions for the air conditioning in the guest manual, no luck so we finally had to call the front desk. It turns out we were supposed to guess that the remote control sitting on the seat of an armchair under the air conditioning unit was the control for it because nowhere in the manual is that mentioned and there is not label on the remote control. Add to that nothing but paper coffee cups and plastic cups in the bathroom and warnings in the guest manual that food from outside the restaurant had to be approved by management and we just really couldn't wait to leave the next morning. At least by then they had the courtesy to put a sign on the front desk regarding the elevator.",2,negative

This time, however, we were strongly disappointed. We had been married the day before and snuck away to Barrie for a couple of days for a mini-honeymoon. When we arrived, Mac was very welcoming and helpful. Our suite, was clean and comfortable, but I half expected to be upgraded as we had mentioned at the time of booking that we were on our honeymoon. Not a big deal that we weren’t, just thought it would have been a nice touch.  The next day (Monday) we left bright and early (7am) to head into Collingwood for the day, hiking, rock climbing and exploring. Upon return to the Inn at 3:30pm, our “please make up room” sign was still on the door, and our key cards were deactivated. My husband went down to the front desk to reactivate our cards, because according to the front desk agent, this happens often.  We finally got into our room, only to discover it hadn’t even been cleaned yet. Now, for some people, this may not be a big deal, but as mentioned earlier, we were out all day rock climbing, exploring, hiking and just wanted to shower and relax before dinner that evening and couldn’t because our room hadn’t been made up. Because housekeeping was right around the corner to finally clean our room, we went for a swim in the pool to kill time.   When bringing this to the attention of the front desk, she explained that this is normal. Because I work at a hotel front desk, I was a little shocked to hear this, as our rooms are cleaned as soon as the guests our out of their rooms, but apparently, ""stay over"" rooms aren’t started until well after 11am and are often not finished before 4pm. The front desk agent then explained that she didn’t know “how housekeeping worked”, which I find a little ridiculous as a front desk agent myself, I know exactly how housekeeping works at my property.  They offered no compensation for the inconvenience and barely muttered a “sorry”.  Because we were on an overnight package, the upgraded breakfast was included. After telling the server that we had the upgraded breakfast, she still presented us with a bill and it was charged back to our room. Upon check out, we brought this to the attention of the front desk agent who quickly removed it. Thankfully there is a Tim Horton's around the corner, because the coffee is terrible.  Unfortunately, I set my expectations too high and was greatly let down. We will definitely not be back as the customer service was lacking... and just lacking all around.",1,negative

Admittedly, the Monte Carlo Suites in Barrie is a nice hotel. It is clean and well kept and in a good location for travelers. However, be aware that the hotel is prone to hosting sporting events with teams of rowdy patrons that the staff is unable or unwilling to control. On our visit, the hotel was infested with teams of screaming 10 year olds, running through the halls and playing in the elevators and teams of 20-somethings who drank, partied and slammed doors as they room hopped until well after midnight. The games began again the following morning at 6:00 am. During this time we made 3 complaint calls to the front desk, which had no effect! We were offered a $5 breakfast upgrade to compensate for our sleepless night. Not until we suggested leaving a day early, that switching our room was suggested. They moved us to another room near the other end of the hall. Saturday night was just a sleep deprived as Friday..... with a drunken herd of hockey players crashing, slamming and shouting their way down the hall to their rooms at 2:40 am! That was the end of our slumber for the night. This was followed by slamming doors and drunken shouting with loud music to boot! At 8:00am we left without the poor complimentary breakfast upgrade and headed for home in an exhausted state of mind and body. Definitely not what we hoped for or paid good money for! Most disappointing!

Pros: spacious room with flat-screen tv in a great position on the wall, comfortable bed and pillows, a microwave, a mini-fridge, and a working bathroom fan! - things I would expect in 4- and 5-star hotels but sometimes don't get. Onsite they had a warm salt-water pool and 24-hr gym. The front-desk day staff was friendly (Thu & Fri afternoon staff) and the night-staff (Thu night) was very helpful in getting loud neighbours to keep it quiet. Loved the 11pm noise curfew, but wish it was posted somewhere.  Cons: it's still a 3-star and small, so expect 1 elevator, a smallish gym. Wifi is free but shared, so when not busy, you can stream netflix; when fully booked, can't even load a page.  Though, independently run separate from the hotel, the onsite restaurant was horrible. Staff were not friendly, pushy, and maybe racist. I only overheard pleasant greetings to Caucasian guests and not the Asian ones. Also, no idea why they call this a buffet when they pushed us out rudely after 30 min. Was not worth the time to repeat the bad experience the next morning, so went elsewhere. Oh, forgot about prior reviews on no ice for butter and cream. Got sick and diarrhea right after eating.

The girl at the front desk was not friendly at all - not even smelling - though from experience, I understand that after a long day of work, it's tiring to keep smiling at guests, though no excuses at all. Hotel managers should do more to insure night staff are at their best even even without supervising. But the very next morning when we go get our breakfast voucher, THAT GIRL is great with us - big bright smile, heard I was ""complaining"" my back to my bf and kindly ask about my sleep last night. Now, THAT is a great customer service!  We went to have our breakfast at the restaurant. Poor lady, it's only her servicing ALL OF US. I saw one gentleman trying to use what seems like an expired voucher and the lady said she's not allowed to accept that. And he got mad. For no good reason, in my opinion - some people just woke up in a bad mood. Understanding people are generally patient since there ONLY ONE SERVER - they really should have better staffing arrangements.   The Room: 4 star I personally love the pictures of Monte Carlo hanging in the rooms. The bed is amazing - I had a great night sleep, my back problem has nothing to do with the bed.  There's coffee maker, fridge, and microwave. We brought some Chinese takeout for dinner, the fridge and microwave really brought us some convince.  The bathroom is amazing. The bath tub is great. I got a chance to take a salt bath after a long day skiing - I went to the near by shoppers and bought the salt.   The Environment: 4 star I absolutely don't get what's all the complain about the hotel environment.  Our room is probably at the worst spot in the entire hotel - so much for discounts - well you get what you pay for. But to my surprise, it's supper quite at night and morning. The staff is supper considerate when going in and out of their Janitor Room next door - I never notice it's there until I came out and saw the sign on the door!

The voucher system for the complementary breakfast worked well, at your could upgrade to a hot breakfast for just $5 although the home fried potatoes were seriously over seasoned and very salty, they did a variety of other hot breakfast too. Standard rooms were fine, clean and tidy, the towels supplied on the small side and I'm not a big person! There seem to be a different set of housekeeping staff for the Sunday night tea/coffee and cups were not replenished. How overall it is good hotel for what and where it is right of the highway they just need to make sure that the leaders of the hockey teams get control over the kids, we would be horrified if any of the kids in our family behaved like they did!!",4,positive

I asked for someone to come check but they told me it was just warming up after I had been there an hour. Never managed to get it working so I asked to switch rooms or get some form of discount. They offered to bring up a portable heater which barely kept the room warm. Went to go to sleep and the 4 curtains didn't even block out the light that was on ALL night. Horrible sleep, cheesy room and rude, unhelpful staff. I even went down to check out and mentioned this politely to give them a chance to do something about it but they just ignored and sent me on my way.

The ""semi-hot"" breakfast that was included in the price of your room ... what a flipping joke! Everything was stale...there was nothing there that was ""semi-warm"". If you wanted eggs, etc. it was all at an additional charge. I saw other people's plates when they ordered the ""extra"" and there was next to nothing on the plate.

Which can you guess what loud luggage thudding and banging all night up and down stairs along with slamming doors for outside does not only for adults but a sleeping toddler ?!! We are all VERY tired. Seeing as how we had to be up at 5 am. The first thing we noticed is the room REEKED of smoke. It's supposedly non smoking but looking out of the window the smoking area is right below the window and the air BLOWING (not leaking in) in around the heating/ac most likely carried the smoke smell into the room. GROSS! Secondly it was a handicap unit so slightly more room BUT we had our daughter so common sense would say give us a room with TWO beds and a tub .. NOPE one ,I'm assuming, queen bed for 3 people and no tub to bathe my 2 yr. old who was having surgery at RVH the next morning. After all that the room was FILTHY! The carpet hadn't been vacuumed in what looked like 5 guests. The bathroom was filthy as well. Nasty pubic hair/body hair on the toilet UNDER the paper ""cleaned"" sticker they put on it and hair all over the walk in shower. The floor had a disgusting white grimey film on it along with toilet paper pieces and dirt.

This is a non smoking hotel but a smell of smoke was detected in the elevator. If i ever come back here, I would insist on a room change.   Bed was comfortable but i woke up with back ache. The bathroom is clean and modern but has virtually no counter space (The Trash had not been emptied from the previous occupant and I left a note for the maid/housekeeper) There's also no ""do not disturb"" signs in the room either, The fireplace was also a disappointing fake.   Heater system /WiFi/ TV worked well. The breakfast included was all carbs and coffee I opted for the upgrade of eggs and ham @ $4.99.  (If i was footing the bill, id choose the Super 8 for location to shopping /restaurants).  This facility is way overpriced for what you get in service, room, and breakfast  As i glance at the other consistent comments here, It appears a staff meeting is in order..

My husband had a medical emergency early the next morning and I will say the head housekeeper was terrific and so nice. So to say the least we were tired and thought after breakfast we can have a much needed nap after the stressful morning cause our check out isn't until 2pm ! Well at 12pm we get a phone call in our room from a very abrupt front  desk lady stating , did we know it's 12 o clock and check out was an hour ago? I said we booked the pkg with the late check out, and she says well that's on availability only and we have a full house. I said oh ok well it would have been nice to know at check in.

The fitness room is small and not good if you like to stretch. The room was fine, always appreciate mini fridge and microwave. The curtains did not pull over so you won't have darkness during the day. The pillows were comfy.

The front desk confirmed a discount of 50% off our stay. When we checked out, it was the same front desk agent and she seemed confused as to why the discount was not applied properly. She went to get the manager and he told us that we were only getting 25% off our stay but he rationalized it in a different way. He never apologized to us for being stuck in the elevator and didn't ask us if we were OK, etc. When I got home I called the customer service line and they did not apologize for the inconvenience either and told us that they thought the discount applied was sufficient, that they had done what they could and when I told them we were stuck in the elevator for almost an hour, she corrected me and said it was 'only' 45 minutes. It was in fact 50 minutes but semantics. I'm pretty sure it wouldn't have been ""only"" 45 minutes if she was in the elevator.  The only good part about this hotel is how nice and sweet the sales lady Kim is. She was stuck in the elevator with us and I am convinced that we would not have even gotten a discount at all if she hadn't convinced the manager.",1,negative

The room was very clean, everything was in working order, the small pool served its purpose when we wanted to let the kids splash around in the afternoon. It is a couple of Kms from the center, so we drove there. The area is not that nice, if convenient, as it is right on the motorway that we needed to join in the morning.   The restaurant served good food, very decent menu and reasonably priced. good service. good local draught beer.   For breakfast, on the first morning we had pancakes (and copious amounts of maple syrup of course), for an additional $5.99 each. On the second day we had the free continental.

We stayed in the Roman suite and even had a jacuzzi tub in the middle of our room. This was a nice feature and was enjoyed thoroughly by my wife and I. Only real issue with the room was that there were paper and plastic cups, instead of a couple glasses or even a wine glass. It seemed odd as we were spending over $200 a night and no reasonable drinking glasses for a room that seemed to be designed around sipping a drink in a two person jacuzzi tub.",4,positive

The room is clean, bathroom very dated. My husband is over 6 feet and I am 5'11, the shower head was positioned mid wall, so we had to crouch to have a shower, Toiletries were the usual. Parking free which was nice. The location is right off the highway, we were not able to hear the cars from what I remember, which was nice. They do offer a free breakfast, which was horrible. Worse than the normal complementary breakfasts at other locations. If you are booking here based on the free breakfast - don't. We didn't use the pool as it was very small and we did not stay in the hotel long enough. Upon checking out, we were not asked how our stay was or thanked for staying there. We basically were asked what room we were checking out of and given the bill to sign. The staff I found were not appreciative; therefore I would not book there again as it was $157 with tax.

The King bed room was very nicely decorated, clean and cozy. Staff are all very pleasant and helpful, from the front desk to the cleaning ladies. The salt water pool is delightful. I was lucky enough to have it all to myself and I really enjoyed it. It was very relaxing indeed.   The hotel is situated in an area where it is handy to downtown restaurants as well as easy driving to the Georgian Mall by taking back streets and avoiding the busy 400 highway. Although the hotel is right off the highway, and there is a lot of traffic noise outside, we could not hear highway noise from our room.   The only criticism I have is that they could do a little better with the included breakfast buffet. They did have brewed decaffeinated coffee, which I much appreciated, since in some hotels they only provide instant decaf, but the croissants were quite stale. It seems if you are going to have pastries they should be fresh each day. Otherwise the breakfast was adequate for our purposes.

This was not the case. Priceline had described two different rooms one they called the spa bath room with a small corner jacuzzi for $81 the other room was described as queen jacuzzi suite for $92. i discovered at arrival that even though priceline had different descriptions and prices. the rooms were the same room the spa bath room. i was very upset as i have a chronic pain disease that has limited my mobility. there was noway i could get in and out of the smaller jacuzzi. I got on the phone with priceline to complain and see what they could do about this. While on the phone one of the reception people Kim came to the room with a free bottle of wine. This i thought was very nice as none of this was the hotels fault. 30 min later and still on the phone with priceline they kept telling me i got the room i booked. at first all i wanted from priceline was a $22 refund for the difference in the price for the same room type. finally priceline said they would escalate this issue to the executives and call me back. by this time i was so upset and stressed out which increased my pain that i was crying. i came back into the the hotel and spoke to Max and made sure to tell him and Kim that i knew none of this was their fault as i could see they were getting very upset as well. I then told them about my chonic pain disease and why i couldnt use the small tub and the need for the larger one. My partner and i had come to Barrie to visit with his children and grandson. I felt my trip was now ruined due to my high stress level and pricelines lack of customer service. While talking to Max we discovered that not only had priceline described the spa bath wrong they had done the same with the other rooms in the hotel!! I went back to my room very very upset and immediately had to take a pain killer. 5 minutes after i got back to my room i had Max from reception call me and tell me that him & Kim had discussed the situation and decided to upgrade us to the Napolean room with the big tub!! I was so over come with emotion i started to cry!. I have to say Max and Kim at the Monte Carlo are excellent at customer service and are now like family to me! My stay at this hotel has become one of my happiest and most memorable events that has happened to me and my partner. We had his grandson over for a visit he is only 1 and he LOVED the tub! We will always use this hotel now and have invited both Kim and Max to stay with us in saint john nb if they ever want to visit the Maritimes.  After all of this i also discovered that the $92 price for the room was not in cdn funds and we were actually charged $140 (taxes in) for the room! in hindsight we should have just called the hotel directly and we could have avoided this whole mess.  As I said previously, even though this was NOT the fault of the hotel Max and Kim took matters into their own hands and made everything right. I cannot say enough good things about them!  Another thing I must tell you about is the restaurant here at the hotel the food is AMAZING!! i DO NOT eat soup at all but the beef noodle soup here was out of this world amazing and i finished all but a taste for my partner to try.  In closing, i totally recommend the Monte Carlo to anyone who is visiting Barrie Ontario!  Lori and Graham

I travel a lot and stay at a lot of hotels around the world and have never encountered one like this one that won't stand up and do what's right. Due to their negligence of not replacing a marker that they installed (and which was subsequently knocked down) to identify a hazard in their parking lot I unfortunately received $1600 worth of damage to my vehicle. They hide behind their emails and voicemails and do not return phone calls. They send their Insurance broker to do their dirty work and completely shun their responsibilities. I would never stay at another hotel in this chain ever again. Unless you are willing to sustain all costs that may be associated with their negligence you should not stay there either!!!,1,negative

Room was clean and bed was comfy with lots of pillows. We were frustrated that we couldn't seem to regulate the heat...had it set at 75 and it was blowing cold air on us. ..eventually just turned it off. They need instructions for the remote for it.

This time we were pleased to find that we could get an ""upgraded"" breakfast from the free continental breakfast for a nominal fee. Unfortunately there seems to be some confusion in the diningroom when bills are handed to people and not everyone felt they should be paying for their upgraded breakfast and subsequently caused a lot of confusion and turmoil in the dining room while others were trying to eat. Perhaps M.C.I. Barrie could look at a system whereby people purchased the upgraded breakfast from the front desk and handed in a ticket/voucher to the dining room staff so there was no confusion and arguing.

It also seems to cater to business travellers, which I like.  However, my daughter and I had a very unfortunate experience when we stayed there 10 days ago. We were there for one night to attend a family event, We had driven 6.5 hours just to get there and my daughter had important work to do on her computer that evening. Unfortunately, it seems that that the wifi access router on our floor was completely down so we were not able to access the internet at all. Before booking that hotel, I had assured my daughter that, as a hotel that caters to business guests, the Monte Carlo would definitely have fast and robust wifi service. Sadly, that wasn't the case. I have since been in touch with management and they have assured me that they are taking immediate action to improve their wifi service. Too little, too late for us.  The room was average but the beds were good. Once the hallway noise stopped we were able to sleep well on the comfortable beds. A continental breakfast at the downstairs restaurant was included, which was nice.   Without the wifi problems, I would have given this hotel 4 of 5 rather than 3 of 5.   So, if you need internet access - before confirming with this hotel, grill them about their internet service. And, as soon as you get into the room, check out the internet access. If it is slow or difficult to access, get on them right away to check the router that serves your room!

37954800,barrie/ca/154980/1488634/37954800.html,Monte Carlo Inn - Barrie Suites,"I do not recommend this hotel to anyone who is looking to book a large group reservation.  We recently used the Monte Carlo Inn - Barrie Suites as the accomodations for our wedding guests.   We had about 30 rooms booked in their hotel for our wedding guests; ten for Friday & Saturday, and twenty for Saturday only. We basically had told everybody to book that hotel because it seemed really nice. BIG MISTAKE. On the Friday, the day before the wedding, I got a phone call from the Monte Carlo telling me that ten of my guest rooms had not checked in Thursday and they were going to be charged for missing their check in. Obviously the ten rooms were not supposed to check in until Friday since the wedding wasn't until SATURDAY! In the Monte Carlo's computers they had messed up the dates and they had all of our guests checking out on Saturday...the day of the wedding! So I had to rush over there and speak to the manager. After waiting in the lobby for a looooooong time, the manager, (Prit,) came out and had the audicity to tell me that maybe all of my wedding guests called in and booked the wrong dates. I told him that I had email proof that they all booked the right dates because on Wednesday the hotel had emailed me a list of rooms that had been reserved. The manager actually said that he wanted to see that email. So of course, I produced it immediately.  At that point, he just said, okay, go through the list and tell him who was staying for one night (Sat only) or two nights (Fri and Sat). We tried to do that, but it was almost impossible, especially since we had to do a million other things during that time! It's the day before my wedding!!!!! When I started to hyperventilate, the manager told me that ""he'll take care of it"" but that he doesn't have all of the rooms available anymore, and that some people who booked suites will not be getting them, and some people will not be getting the rooms that they booked ie King beds, or non-smoking etc. We decided that we cannot accept that we don't care what he has to do, but he has to fix this problem. He told us not to worry and that he will fix it.  We left them with our 30 welcome baskets for our guests and went to our wedding rehearsal.  Later that night, we found out that the welcome baskets had been given out to guests of another wedding! And those guests nearly missed their wedding because our welcome baskets had our timetables printed in them! So, not all of our guests got a basket and who knows how many of the other wedding got ours.   Next, I found out that one person from our wedding party, Mitch, who had booked a suite was not given his suite, but he told me not to worry about it. I was fuming, and I asked the man at the front desk why the manager had lied to me earlier, and the man at the front desk (Andrew) said quote ""I don't know. I don't care. I only work here and I'm glad that I won't be here tomorrow."" I told him that tomorrow is my wedding day and I will not be spending it talking to the manager again! So no suite for Mitch.  So my wedding day comes and we asked the front desk to give the booteneer and coursage to my future mother-in-law and future father-in-law when they checked in. Of course they screwed that up and did not do that. Who knows what happened to the flowers??!!  Throughout the course of the day, the manager decides that he is going to put Mitch in the suite that he was supposed to be in, however, Mitch is unavailable because he is at our wedding! So, the manager decides to get three of his staff to physically move Mitch's clothes and personal belongings to his new suite WITHOUT HIS KNOWLEDGE OR PERMISSION.   Fast forward to 3:00 am and Mitch is arriving back to the hotel after the wedding and tries to enter his room, only he can't. So he goes to front desk for assistance, who finally figure out that his room has been switched. He finds out the new room number and goes there only to find that half of his stuff is missing. He goes back to the front desk to tell them and they gave him the same response that I got the night before, basically, too bad, they don't care, and he'll have to speak to the manager tomorrow. Ugh! They would not let him enter his original room because there were new people in there!  So, basically the manager Prit was not there the next day, but he did eventually call Mitch and tell him that ""sorry they lost his stuff"". There's nothing they can do except comp his room for Saturday night. Um, excuse me?! Mitch is missing about $300 worth of brand new clothes and about $200 worth of gift certificates. He brought nice stuff with him because there were wedding events that he was attending!!   At this point, I plan to go right to the Monte Carlo head office and tell them what happened. Needless to say, Mitch's stuff is gone, and he'll never get that back. I am so unhappy with the way we were treated and I wish that we had not picked that hotel to have our guests stay. There are so many other better hotels around and I just hope that no one else has to go through what we did. It almost ruined my wedding!  If you are considering having your friends or family stay there, I would definitely reconsider. Stay away from this hotel with the thieving staff!",1,negative

Because the inn is newly opened, the facility itself was excellent. The rooms were very clean and nicely appointed and I thought the price - $109/night for 2 queen size beds - was excellent.  There do seem to be a few bugs that still need ironing out, though. Front desk service, with the exception of the manager, left something to be desired, as the staff seemed a little overwhelmed at times by things that shouldn't ""throw"" front desk staff (ie., 4 or 5 people at the desk at once). A continental breakfast was included with our room and we only found out by accident that you could also order eggs or french toast. Also, the small restaurant on the premises is badly set up - breakfast wait staff had to jockey for position to replenish pastries/coffee etc. in the same place as patrons were trying to help themselves. They definitely need to re-think that set-up as it's very inconvenient.  Overall though, a place I would certainly recommend and I feel sure that personnel problems will be ironed out with time.

387877189,barrie/ca/154980/1488634/387877189.html,Monte Carlo Inn - Barrie Suites,"So, this little hotel is next to the Quality Inn and Comfort Suites, JUST off the 401(?) highway. It's easily accessible, close to downtown Barrie and 10 minutes from shopping, restarants Walmart etc. What I likes was that the room had a mini fridge AND microwave. The beg could have been bigger but room size impacts that. The full-sized tub was AWESOME as was the water pressure and quick scalding hot water. The water temp was great for washing baby bottles on the go! I had some trouble connecting to wifi at first but it eventually worked, and the T.V. channel selection was ok.  The continental breakfast was average - I guess. I was on a protien meal plan so couldn't partake in any of it (no eggs or ham/bacon) and the $4.99 upgrade only gave me 2 fried egg whites - they couldn't scramble, couldn't add any vegetables - nada. Not worth the $.  I took my 1yo to the indoor pool for a dip and enjoyed that.  All in all, I'd recommend this as a good value for money - especially after having been subjected to the Quality Inn in Buffalo a few days before!
 
 
 Room Tip:  4th floor on the wing away from the Elevators eliminates Highway noise and hallway traffic.

The room is decent and was very clean. No complaints with it. Had a fireplace in a corner for a nice effect but we placed our bikes in front of it so no clue if it works. Handy to have a small fridge and microwave. Had a combined fan and light for the bathroom which I never like but the bathroom was spacious enough. Bed was comfortable and afforded a good nights sleep. A/C is rather loud and we found it had a musty smell so we limited the use of it. Continental breakfast is very basic but with cereal, toaster for bread or bagels, yoghurt, fruit, coffee, tea and juice,it fit the bill. They kept the items well stocked and cleaned up after every guest which was nice to see for a change. The saltwater pool is small and really warm, like almost hot tub warm! Murky colour did not make it overly welcoming but we enjoyed ourselves regardless. Pool area is also very warm. The door to outside was propped open which was adjacent to the smoking area which meant we were swimming while smelling smoke which eventually we had enough of and left the pool area. The pool area does not seem to be cleaned very well as band aids seen on day one were still there on day two. Nice to have a free paper available and front desk agents were very pleasant. Wifi was not overly strong and could be fickle at times to sign in, but usually worked fine once you got in. Overall we would be there again for a short stay as the price was right. Only 1.5 km from the waterfront so the location was good and you did not hear hwy 400 which is right in front.",4,positive

The room was clean and adequate with free wifi, a microwave, coffee maker and fridge. Staff was friendly and helpful. Continental breakfast is provided with a selection of bagels, muffins, croissants, pastries, yogurt, cold cereals, toast, fresh fruit, juice, coffee and tea. You can upgrade to eggs and bacon for $5.

At least 10 rooms were booked. You would think bringing that kind of business there that you would get a slight discount or a small extra included (we weren't provided anything) Rooms are a little small; our room had a 'musty' smell to it. Other family members had the same observation as well. They advertise that breakfast is included but it is an extremely small continental breakfast with cereal and a few pastries/toast that are included. You have to pay extra to add eggs/bacon etc, which is very small in portion. I would recommend going off site for breakfast.  Front desk staff were friendly. WIFI included.

396678522,barrie/ca/154980/1488634/396678522.html,Monte Carlo Inn - Barrie Suites,"We stayed at the Monte Carlo Inn on July 23, 2016 for just one night. The hotel entrance/lobby area is nice. The room itself was very average but it had a very funny smell, almost like cinnamon but not in a good way. The beds were comfortable and the bathroom was pretty standard. Our in-room fridge was dirty, it looked like someone had spilled something in it before us and it was never properly cleaned out. The hotel was also supposed to have free WiFi but we were never able to actually log on properly to get it working.   The pool says that the maximum occupancy is 17 persons but I have a hard time believing that you could fit more than 5 - 7 adults in there at a time. We had 4 kids and 2 adults in there and it felt pretty crowded. The pool is very small and it definitely appears very aged. The water looked yellowish-green and the kids were initially put off by it but I think it was only the aged bottom of the pool that as giving off that colour. There is no hot tub and the pool water is pretty chilly.   As for the free breakfast, it only really includes, coffee/tea, pastries, bagels/bread with cream cheese, butter, peanut butter and jam. The add on option for $4.99 plus tax and gratuities includes eggs, hashbrowns and bacon or sausage. We chose the add on option but I wish we would have just gone somewhere else to have breakfast. The eggs were incredibly greasy, the hashbrowns (which I didn't have at all) were very dried out and the bacon wasn't quite done and was super greasy as well.   Overall, if you are staying at the hotel overnight as you are passing through it's a clean and nice place to lay your head down and get some rest. If you are planning on staying and making a fun weekend for the kids with the pool and having the breakfast included, I would recommend somewhere else.

399928658,barrie/ca/154980/1488634/399928658.html,Monte Carlo Inn - Barrie Suites,"Very, very rude staff...maybe they should look for other work where they don't have to work with people. Let's start with the hotel staff, the young lady there was pleasant, got a room which was clean but very small, very deep tub so with a bad knee very difficult to step in to shower, room smell was funny smelling and felt very damp. The wifi, is a joke if you need wifi, use your phone, very hard to log on and it kicks you out all the time. We booked a 2 night stay at a very expensive price, availability in Barrie was vey limited at that time, so they took advantage of this. The pool as everyone states is so small we could not be bothered to use it, which was a real disappointment. Now for the free continental breakfast that is included, if you want to be yelled at and encounter rude staff by all means go to the breakfast room. You need to get a coupon from the front desk, as soon as you walk in they want that coupon, the breakfast is the cheapest quality of food that they can find, and if you want eggs it's another $4.99 plus taxes. We did not bother. The women there on the Friday morning was not very friendly had to ask for fruit as she forgot it, then finally after we ate came out with a few bananas and apples, we did not have time to wait, as we needed to go, we wanted to finish our coffee in our van my husband was given a hard time about this. Next morning Sunday they don't open until 7 am, so this would make our morning more rushed, we picked up our coupons and checked out, and arrived for breakfast right at 7 am we took in our own mugs immediately we were told by Jeff that we were not aloud in with our mugs. I asked why I could not drink my coffee from my own mug? He then started yelling at me that it was policy, that I had to drink from coffee from their cups and not from my mug, he then yelled at me that at Tim Hortons that they would not let me bring in my own mug, Really I said I do it all the time and they even rinse it and fill it with a smile. He then shut up. I proceeded to fill their little cup with coffee and take it to my table, with difficultly as I have wrist issues , I use a mug with a lid so that my coffee stays hot and I don't spill, and burn myself. As we ate the stale, low quality bagels I noticed 3 cute young ladies come in with NO coupons they stood at the bar drank juice and took fruit and other items to go, Jeff said something to them and then smiled and they left with all their suitcases. When we were leaving I asked Jeff why he did not yell at those girls who took food and drank juice and presented no coupons he said they said they would be back ( yah sure they had there suitcases) he then again started yelling at me, along with the other girl, his backup. I told him my cup was empty I was not taking any of that bad priceless coffee and that I did appreciate being yelled at and embarrassed in front of other customers. He then stated in a loud voice that he did not yell at me, but just raised his voice..,hmm raised voice means yelling, then he told me that his employer takes $3.00 off his pay check when he does not people an extra $2.50 for drinking out of a travel mug. His coworker then joined in the yelling, as I was walking out. I went promptly to the front desk to lodge a complaint but there was a note to state that no one was there, and would be back in 5 minutes, we left to NEVER EVER return to that hotel or any other Monte Carlo hotels.

Spoke with Melissa at the front desk, explained what went down, they allowed us to check in very early (11am). Room was absolutely beautiful, clean and dust free. Had a minor set back with our jacuzzi tub and Lindsay (front desk manager) stepped in and upgraded our room to the Romeo and Juliette Room. This room is absolutely stunning two levels, king size bed, jacuzzi, and two fireplaces (which operate even in the summer). The hotel even gave us a complimentary bottle of amazing wine. I can't say enough about this hotel and it's staff. The in house restaurant is absolutely amazing they take such good care of their guests and the food is amazing. Not even over priced (as one would expect for room service). If you stay here you definitely have to have their pizza and wings better than most restaurants that specialize in pizza and wings . The staff and hotel were so amazing that we decided to stay another night and even though the room we were currently in wasn't available through amazing service hasn't stopped. Continental Breakfast is included in your stay and the restaurant has an upgrade deal for $4.99 definitely worth it. I would recommend anyone take at least one night and come stay here. You won't want to leave the staff treat you like you are truly one of the family. Our second room while not as big as the first was adequeate and very clean. The beds in both rooms are extremely comfortable. Even switching rooms was very easy.

The room had a horrible musty smell when we arrived so we quicky turned on the a/c and tried to vent it out. Unfortunately there was a party going on in the room next to us which carried out into the hallways around 130am. Loud, screaming, talking, laughing, slamming doors.  We opened our door to see the front desk staff standing in the hall trying to move them back into their room and quiet them down.  Just obnoxious and rude people. Needless to say we didn't get to have the restful and much needed sleep we were looking to grab. Breakfast on site was a nice feature. There are complimentary bagels, toast, english muffins, muffins, strudels, coffee and tea but if you prefer a hot breakfast you can get one for $5.

The rooms were tidy and efficient with a microwave, small empty bar fridge and single cup coffee maker ready for use. The bathroom had all the essentials including a clean and modern bathtub/shower unit. Like other hotel chains including the Hampton suites by Hilton, there was a complimentary continental breakfast attached to this day. It consisted of hot coffee or tea, cereals, yogurt, fresh fruit, bread or bagels with the appropriate condiments. There was an offer to upgrade the breakfast for a small fee. There was a fitness room and a small indoor pool which would have been appreciated by any children that would have been travelling.

Check in was quick and pretty much effortless. They handed my partner a rose for the occasion. It was a good start. When we arrived, we found that they had a special for an extra $100 to receive $60 off the restaurant, a complimentary bottle of wine, chocolate covered strawberries and a later check out time. We opted for that.   We got to our suite and it was everything they said it was on the surface. It didn't take long before the little discrepencies started to surface. There were no glasses. Odd to not have glasses in the room. The tub had pubic hair in it. Ok, they were rushed to get it ready earlier. That can slide. The TV ""crashed"". Leaving it for a bit and turning it back on resolved the problem.   The internet was down all day the first day. Rogers had a major problem, knocking out the whole city. Not the hotels fault, but added to the negative aura surrounding this trip. Sitting in the Jacuzzi we could clearly hear the yelling and screaming of little children in the pool down the hall and a floor down.   Sound proofing seemed non-existant. The architects who designed the building should find a new hobby. A couple of walls outside were even crooked. Some mouldings didn't fit properly. One moulding around the jacuzzi was already starting to let go. You could tell corners were cut all over the place.  We go down for dinner. It was underwhelming. The steak was a very poor quality cut. I expected a lot more for $95.00 for the two of us. Not at all acceptable. The chef was a great guy, very personable. He served us personally as there were no other staff on hand. The salads were very good. My partner's pasta was good. My steak was overcooked. Not surprising, considering it was one cut above ""tenderized"". I doubt I could have done much more with it myself.  At the end of the dinner we tipped generously for his congeniality and efforts and left.  That night we were kept up all night with the sound of water running through piping. Apparently one of the other guests decided filling their jacuzzi every hour between 10 PM and 4 AM was a great idea. Proper design would have prevented this rather loud intrusion on our sleep.  I woke up feeling exhausted. A very poor sleep. Breakfast was good. Part of the extra $100 was a free upgrade ($3.95/person) to a hot breakfast. Excellent french toast, bacon perfectly cooked to my liking. Some horrible morning show on TV. A waste of air time, particularly since the Olympics were airing and would have made a much better choice.  We decided to check out early. Great tub, but not an enjoyable stay. On checkout we get the bill of $350. The bill was pushed across the counter with ""check this and make sure it's ok"". There's a ""gratuity"" included of almost $18.00. Gratuity??? When confronted about it we were abruptly informed that it was stated on our sign in card that taxes and gratuities were extra. Well, ok. That's pretty much always a given. We weren't told it was forced on us. Why was there a place for gratuity on our dinner and breakfast receipts if they were just going to take one anyways?  We were informed that they had received lots of complaints about it. She asked if we would like to do something about it. I told her for the $18 it would probably take more time than it's worth. She agreed that it took a long time to reverse the charge. A complete customer service fail.  I felt that we didn't receive anywhere close to the $350 value we paid for. I took the time to call customer service. No answer. It's an answering machine. I left a message, fully expecting to not hear back (and certainly I wasn't disappointed. We didn't). I called the manager of the hotel to give them our feedback. As a business owner I always value and act on any feedback, good or bad. He promised he would look into it, took our contact information and we never heard back from him either.  I immediately thought back to our trip to the Mariott Fallsview and how, for the same money our experience was completely different. Everything from the atmosphere, service, the room, the restaurant, right down to how rested I felt. My overall impression of the Monte Carlo is that it's an overpriced Holiday Inn Express.  So many small things added up to a lack luster, mediocre, overpriced experience that was big on claims, but fell far short on delivery. It's definitely one of the nicest hotels in Barrie, yet still leaves a lot to be desired especially at the price point.  With the nice facilities, there is a lot of potential. However the current management appears to either be clueless how to run a hotel or just doesn't care.",3,negative

We never spend more than we have to so having a room with a jacuzzi and big piers, and a fireplace was awesome! Sure if you want to point out every little thing the molding was cracked in one spot, and yea, there was a hair in the tub, but honestly, does that really affect the quality of your stay? Everything else was spotless! The bed was soooo comfortable, i wanted to take it home!! The cons; the breakfast was not so great, average, but just kinda drab. And room service is cut off at 11pm! Also, we had a room by the pool, and during the day it was a bit noisy. At night however, you could hear a pin drop. Kinda made late night romance feel like we were back at the parents place... ;P But all in all I was very pleased to taste a little bit of luxury for a decent price, and I would definitely return!! Oh yeah, and my husband left his cell phone in the room, and when we called back 6 hours later, they confirmed they still had it, and kept it in the safe until we could arrange something!

Pros: Most of the staff was polite and friendly; even the waiter at the restaurant that waited on us at 10 in the evening, then waited on us again at 6 am for breakfast (I'd be grouchy as hale with that kind of schedule!). The room was kept very clean, and the beds were bedbug free (novel!). Also, free breakfast until 10am; and they don't bat an eyelash over people that roll out of bed and sit down wearing a hoodie pulled over her eyes and pajama bottoms.  Cons: The ""high speed wireless internet"" they boast about on their site is a joke. Sure it was wireless, but it runs like dial-up circa 1997. The bathroom light switch also turns on the VERY LOUD exhaust, with no way to shut off the exhaust and just have the light. Stepping in to the bathroom is like stepping in to an airplane hangar. The lady who checked us out was incredibly grumpy. Their restaurant's food was nothing to write home about. Everything there is smothered in shredded carrots and fiberous leeks. Not to mention it's overpriced. Bad coffee, too, but that's not surprising.  All in all? Decent place and location is close enough to lots of restaurants and the downtown area.",3,negative

The kids loved the pool and hot tub and it was the perfect way to end a very cold day on the ski hills. What we enjoyed most about the hotel was the staff!

The pool is kinda small but at least there is one. Beware if you’re traveling for peace and quiet during the winter season. The hotel was jammed full with young hockey teams with the children unattended playing soccer in the hallways and the parents going from room to room with a beer in their hand. I'm sure if I called the front desk it would of been addressed but I didn't personally mind. And it didn't stop us from sleeping..., well sound proof rooms... but it did stop us from going for a swim until after 10pm. I didn't change in the change room but my 16 yr old did and he said they were dirty. The pool was over full with children....luckily we love kids but I don't think others who want calmness would appreciate it. However...all, in my opinion would looove the food! The buffet had more than enough to choose from, hot, fresh and excellent value and quick service. We sat down right away and even though it was buffet our waitress was very attentive. It wasn't full, my guess is that the hockey parents went for the MacDonald budget menu nearby. We loved how close to everything the hotel is located. We tried out the SnowValley Tubing.....oh my gosh!!! Intimidating...and beware of the loooong line up! It took us 2 hrs. for 4 slides down the hill!

Our stay was great. There is a lot of parking (more around back) and several access/entry points into the building. One of the best things about the hotel is the restaurant: Tattinger's. On the night of our stay, there was a buffet for $20 person/adult. It was not huge (like the Mandarin next door), but I would highly recommend it. First, you can't beat the price. Second, it's on sight, but not in a highly-trafficked/busy area: It definitely feels like a restaurant, not a ""hotel restaurant"". Third, the food was delicious!!! On the night we were there, they were featuring mouthwatering roast beef, yorkshire pudding, horseradish - the whole bit. My wife does not eat beef or pork and she was more than happy with delicious homemade salads (potato, seafood, pasta, green), veggies (raw and steamed), rice, chicken, soup, breads and desserts. The restaurant is really cozy with a giant fireplace on one wall and tables far enough apart that you still feel private during dinner. There is also a fairly big bar/lounge and we were able to watch some sports afterwards and have a few drinks.

The towels are threadbare. The carpet is greyed with age and devoid of any pile. A flourescent light in the entryway doesn't do the room any favours. The bathroom is the biggest opportunity area- expect plumbing fittings that haven't been updated since the Cretaceous era. One plus: they hadn't invented low-flow shower heads when this place was put together.   Barrie is not a large city, so by some measure you would expect this to be the premier hotel in town.

We stay in the Barrie area approximately once a year and this property has gone further down in quality every time. This time I had a feeling of staying at the roadside motel - problems begun with the check in. Most of our guests had wrong reservations, I, as the contact person for the group, was marked down as ""paying cash"", while everybody else had the company credit card indicated. Some members of our group were arriving the next day - their rooms got canceled; so they had to fight to get a room at all, etc. At check in, the two employees were fighting over whether to give us breakfast vouchers, we clearly heard the going back and forth ""no, they can't - yes, they can - give them one only - no, I'll give them two because they'll come back and complain"". It was almost surreal watching these two employees. Finally, we got the breakfast vouchers to the obvious dismay of one of the check in persons. As we were moved around the hotel, of course, the keys did not work once we got to the room, so my colleague had to go back to the front desk. In the meantime, the maintenance person showed up and let me in the room. I had a feeling I was on a reality show...  The room itself was basic and quite filthy, there was lots of dust bunnies in the corners, the carpet was stained and there was hair (not ours) in the bathroom. The beds and pillows were quite comfortable though. The good thing about the room was the balcony, but there was no balcony furniture not even a plastic chair.  The only saving grace is the fact that there is a bar / restaurant on site, so you don't have to drive around Barrie looking for a place to eat after a long day at work. Our kudos to the bar tender who was kind enough to find a table for our group in the packed restaurant - thank you!  Overall, stay in this place only if you have to. We have to come back next year, and I sincerely hope that by that time another hotel will have opened in Barrie.",1,negative

The breakfast was just so pleasant with yummy pancakes and anything else you'd like for the morning meal to start the day off right. The pool was very clean and water temperature just right along with the spa area. We checked out the Churchill Banquet Room for weddings and it was beautifully decorated in chair covers and bows with beautiful flower arrangements, a romantic black and white head table and sheer decor backdrop with matching cake table with a black and white wedding cake. I'm sure any bride and groom along with their guests would be wowed by the *bling* in that room! The conceiges were right on top of things and I received a wake up call when I asked for one. The other staff we met were more than willing to show us around and explain all the details concerning our stay. All we can say is we really enjoyed our stay and YES we'll be back.

We stayed here from Friday July 1st to Sunday July 3rd for two nights. 2 adults no kids.  Checking in: Took over 5minutes... mind you, there was no line in front or behind me... The lady clerk who served me was very unprofessional and unfriendly.  Room: We had a queen size bedroom\pool view\no balcony... Room was outdated... besides the nice 32"" flat screen the room needs major updating... light in bathroom is very dull and to make matters worse, when getting ready for bed, we pulled the curtain-only to have it fall on us..!! We reported it to the Hotel and nothing was done about it.   Pool: I understand the pool is 'animal friendly' but maybe a little to friendly in my opinion to allow a dog to swim in the pools facility. The indoor pool smelled so awful that we were disgust! We were in the shower for over 20min trying to just get the stomach-upsetting smell off our bodies and hair!  Location: Is great, right near the highway and close to the Centennial Park beach.  Conclusion: I would not stay at this Hotel again, staff needs further training, and the place needs major updating. Although if traveling with kids.. it has 2 pools [indoor & outdoor] and a nice mini park.

First, it was so easy to get to right off the highway and up on a hilll so its clearly visible. The hotel room was great, simple decor and lovely colours and a balcony facing the courtyard. At first we got a room with a walk out right into the parking lot, but the front desk staff were extremely understanding and very helpful when I asked to change it. The beds were so comfortable I could have slept all day long. Tattingers Restaurant was fantastic! The staff are so nice and so helpful - they even entertained my kids while I went up to get their meal from the buffet The breakfast buffet was so delicious that my kids even asked for a second helping! We enjoyed the spending time in the playground in the courtyard and visited both the indoor and the outdoor pools - my only somewhat negative comment is that there was a little too much cholrine in the pool - it made our skin a little itchy and red for a little while. All in all it was the most fun and relaxing vacation I've ever had! I'm already planning for next year!!!

Also included fresh fruits and yogurts. Tattinger's has a great lounge & the same breakfast dining area is also the dining area for dinner. However, many seemed to seat in the lounge and still eat dinner - a nicer atmosphere with TV access. I will highly recommend hotel to my work colleagues! Staff was excellent, helpful, and always smiling! Very close to lots of dining options: Mandarin, Tatinger's on site, down the hill Tim Horton's , Pizza Hut , etc.  CONS: I'm female traveling alone so when I got a 2nd floor room, I thought I'd be separated from all other foot traffic from restaurants & conference center meeting rooms. My 2nd floor towards back was the back parking lot. While glass doors locked, I still worry about safety.   Also, no elevator for the 2nd floor.

The room was very clean and comfortable. The beds were excellent. Internet access was simple and connection was fast.  The above being said, I found the front desk staff unfriendly and very curt. Due to the amount of material I had at my meetings (in boardrooms that were too small and excessively warm), I had banker's boxes stacked on a two wheel cart. After searching unsuccessfully for a ramp or an elevator, I was forced to transport the cart down a set of stairs into the lobby. Rather than offering to assist me, or point me in the direction of a ramp or elevator, I was met instead with dirty looks due to the noise made by the cart as it bounced down the stairs.   Undoubtedly, there must have been an elevator, but there were no visible signs referring to such,   The restaurant, as well, had very limited selection for late evening business travellers - the choice was a very limited selection of bar food. The food itself was average, and nothing to write home about. Service in the restaurant was, however, pleasant and quick.  As a regular visitor to Holiday Inn hotels, my stay in Barrie is recollected as my most unpleasant experience to date (of any hotel, actually) as far as front desk personnel are concerned. I can only hope that this experience was an abberation - this kind of curtness was unlike anything I've ever experienced over the last several years staying at Intercontinental Hotels (the brand under which all Holiday Inns are managed).  Not sure if I will return or not (I may try the Barrie Holiday Inn Express instead - at least the breakfast there is free and unlimited - one of the things that confounds me about Holiday Inn hotels - i.e. why Holiday Inns have breakfast charges, whereas Holiday Inn Expresses have a wonderful breakfast buffet included in the price with nightly room rates that are often the same or less than the Holiday Inn Express located in the same city.

I take to task the notation that ""visitor resented being called ""sweetie, dear"" etc. which seems to indicate that people, places and things ""annoy"" her as she proceeded to rip up the hotel in every area. Yes, there are areas of improvement but we enjoyed the professional and helpful reception staff and all the amenities. Staff were wiling to carry our luggage and assist in any way possible. We throughtly enjoy the prime rib buffet and the Sunday brunch, good range of ""excellent"" food with attentive and thoughtful staff. There were so many events going on in other banquet rooms and obviously a lot of work behind the scenes. We are coming back with more of the family and grand-babies. Of note the hotel is not apologizing for any lack but are making it up in services and will be putting in a new ""salt water pool"" in the summer while we use the outdoor pool. Lots of good things are happening, the rooms are clean, comfortable and well equipped for families with comfortable beds, extra bedding, plenty of pillows, not to mention fridge/freezer, microwave. There are people who take offence to everything in life, and I say ""lighten up"".

Last week, my girlfriend and I found ourselves in Barrie at 2am on our way to Muskoka, unable to continue our journey because of the massive and sudden snowfall. (we did not check road conditions before we left southern ontario, as we were not experiencing severe weather). Your friont desk attendant, Michelle, informed us we would not find a single room anywhere in Barrie because of numerous large events, including a broom-hockey championship. So there we were, with a car stuck in the snow in the parking lot, tired, wet, and without a clue how to proceed. we didn't know anyone in Barrie. Michelle and a security guard managed to pull together some pillows and blankets and let us bunk in a small unused conference room (for a low fee which we were more than happy to pay).  We can not express our gratitude to your staff''s friendly demeanour, and willingness to help us out in a bad situation. Michelle and the gentleman are to be commended.",5,positive

We were well taken care of by Jenny the Waitress at dinner and again on Sunday brunch and it was a pleasure having her looking after us. It's no wonder the management has her on staff as she makes everyone feel right at home. We will definitely recommend this hotel to any of our friends who visit us in the future.

While I normally stay in the tower (and did this stay), all rooms have now been upgraded to a modern standard. For the price, everything is just right. Dinner at Tattingers wasn't up to par in part due to the fact the Jennie wasn't working. The young server didn't grasp the fact that 20 people in a restaurant and lounge didn't warrant a 45 minute wait to receive your meal. In any case, I won't let my meal experience affect my rating of the accomodations as there are other restaurants that I could have visited.   The best hotel in Barrie.

Quite an overwhelming smell of chlorine as you walk to the front desk...We were taken on the scenic route (3 flights of stairs and down a long hallway) to be shown a room on the second floor that had been ""recently renovated."" The room had some very cheap renos done and was just not worth the $150 in my opinion. Asked again had it been renovated and he answered yes...My friend and I had a little laugh and left the room. The carpeting on the stairway and into the hallway was old, dirty and quite shabby looking. But the deal closer was as we walked to the top of the stairs we had an overwhelming smell of cigarette smoke. I asked him if the hotel allowed smoking? He mentioned that down the hall and around the corner there was smoking rooms... So again I said it is smoking in here? He didn't seem to want to answer but did eventually. I have nothing against people who choose to smoke but I will not pay that kind of money to be exposed to second hand smoke. There was alot of children in this building and his answer surprised me. Almost $150 for that? We thanked him for showing us the room and left the building.

Its the first time I've seen trees and a little play area outdoors for kids at a hotel. A great outdoor pool as well as the indoor one. A good fitness room. Lovely buffet for breakfast was included with the room but unfortunately only for one person when both myself and my husband were staying there. That didn't make much sense to me. Other than that everything was fabulous. I'd stay there anytime i needed a room in Barrie.

To lobby is new, modern and clean which is likely why the room was such as disappointment. My room was dated, dated, dated. It appeared clean but I had to wonder because of all the fruit flies in it. The patio door for my room had a lock that was missing one of the 2 screws to keep the mechanism fixed to the door and I'm sure a good tug would have broken it. Scary for a first floor room. The ceiling in my room had a hole in it. Yup, you read right, a hole. It was about 18"" in diameter and the ceiling sagged all around it. I'm pretty sure it was water damage and I'm also pretty sure it had been there a while. The chain for the front door was too short to secure into the lock on the door also - the room was a disaster to say the least. I have stayed at cheap no name motels with nicer rooms. Gag. The bed was comfortable and I appreciated the choice of firm or soft pillows.  The only saving grace of this dive in disguise was the restaurant. The breakfast buffet was excellent and the only reason I gave this place a two stars. My advice...stay elsewhere.",2,negative

This is why I was shocked when we went to HolidayInn Barrie. It has great reviews here in tripadvisor .   The day of our arrival, we got our first impression: old looking hotel, it was modern a few years ago. The checkin lady was not specially nice not specially nasty, she just wanted to get the job done.  They gave us a queen executive room, which has a small bed actually, it is really a small queen.  The room is a bit old, the worst things on it was the Aircon Fan., It is super noisy everytime it activates , it creates a groaning noise that is shocking and scary when you are trying to rest. Like an old fridge trrrruuurrrrrr.   The water faucets, well they have two handles, and it was very difficult to get the right temperature.   Another annoy thing: You can hear your neighbors toilet every time they flush.   And the worst of the worst was that there was a party on the hotel !!! There was noise all the way till MIDNIGHT !!!!!  IT is not so fun when you have a child trying to catch some sleep.  The music was loud and all the way into the night, what a joke of hotel this is !!!!!  Two stars because the room service was fast and the food was decent.

Holiday Inn Barrie is pretty much the most convenient, affordable and decent place we've found to stay while we're in the city. We first gave it a shot on the recommendation of friends, who also stay there every time they go to Barrie.  The Mandarin is right next door and their food is AWESOME. The outdoor pool at the hotel is okay... last time we went, they were just finishing renos on the indoor pool, so we took the kids in the outdoor pool. It feels like it's in an awkward place... like you're really exposed, as many of the hotel windows from the corridors and restaurants seem to look over the pool. It would be nice to have a bit more privacy, just my opinion.  The rooms at this hotel are decent - nothing spectacular, but clean and tidy and in good repair. We'll be staying there again.

While the facility and amenities fully met our expectations of quality and function, the staff make the real difference. From the moment we checked in with Amanda, right through to our extended check out, our experience was flawless. Amanda went above and beyond the call (during a busy time) to accommodate the unique requests of a family stay. Then, the service (and value) recieved from Adrienne and Jenny at Tattinger's Lounge kept us coming back for more the entire weekend. Typically, our family ends up a local chain restaurants but the quality of the food and service was so good, we opted to take advantage of the convenience and atmosphere of the hotel. On day two, we enjoyed the breakfast buffet with Jenny serving us (who is as good as solid gold by the way) and also the brunch on sunday with Kari and Adrienne back on staff. The prime rib was fantastic. It is hard work to provide the experiece these folks created for us... and they clearly do it consistently for all guests.

The pool Sat night was down right murky & the pool deck dirty with mystery stuff you didn't want to step on. Since it was so busy we understood until we went down to use it Sunday and still dirty. Big hairballs floating in pool, murky water, dirty deck. Thought they'd clean overnight. Resturant food was great as was wait staff. Hostess was frazzeled and gave us 1 menu for 3 people and didn't ask if we wanted the brunch that hubby spotted them bringing out roast beef mintes after our order.

We received a room at the back of the hotel with lots of parking available. The room was comfortable and clean. It had a great king-size bed with many pillows. The t.v. was large; a microwave and fridge were also in the room. A sofa and desk/chair completed the furniture. Ample lighting throughout the room was helpful. One odd thing was that in place of a formal closet, there was simply an open-concept rack with hangers! The bathroom was spotless and tastefully done. However, the most negative aspect of the room was that we could hear others using their washroom next door, if you get my drift.   Another unpleasant feature was that the noise from passers-by in the hallway could be easily heard from our room. Hence, I was forced to use my earplugs when going to sleep....  There were far too many kids using the large indoor pool so we did not avail ourselves of it A hot tub was available.

I decided on the Holiday Inn because they had room service and were close to the 400 so that I could drive to the airport the next day. In terms of location, it's easy to find and get to. The downside of the location is that there isn't a whole lot else around, although there are a few restaurants about 100m down Fairview Road. Check-in was quick, but I was a bit underwhelmed with the room. Given that I had spent the extra money for the Queen Executive Suite, I expected a bit more. The carpet was dated and kind of gross and I simply could not work out how to order in-room movies on the TV (not that it's worth it at $12/movie). The room at least was clean. The bathroom was fine, although I have a pet peeve about hotel bathrooms that lack exhaust fans. Perhaps the most frustrating was finding out that there were no vending machines on the floors listed in the services guide in the room. Instead, you are expected to go down to the lobby and purchase something from the 'shop', which is basically a closet that happens to have some soft drinks and chips. This is the second Holiday Inn that did this in a week, so I expect that this is a trend that is spreading throughout their chain.  Overall, it's on ok Holiday Inn. Nothing spectacular and perfectly serviceable for a night or two.",3,negative

It felt like we were right at home at our moms. She treated our kids like they were her own. Jenny deserves 2 thumbs up for her hard dedication to her job and making people welcome. We made a point before we left to go and see Jenny to say good bye and thanks again.

Nice size rooms coffee and tea in the rooms with a microwave and mini fridge. The pool was a nice size to. The only complaint i have was the beds, it was too soft for me, but everyone is different. Bathroom was nice and clean, shower had good pressure nothing i hate more than trying to have good pressure while taking a shower. Other than the bed, i cant say i was disappointed in our stay here.

Based on the location of the hotel and the reviews of my fellow Tripadvisors, who gave good ratings, we decided to give it a try. Upon check-in we were told that the main building is considered the ""Executive Tower"" and we would have to upgrade ($$) to stay there. We immediately upgraded our room to avoid being placed in a room on the perimeter of the hotel in the two level buildings. The room was clean and a good size. We were on the fifth floor and the room was quiet. We are not sure why it is considered the ""Executive Tower"", but fine. Overall it was fine for the area.

A large flat screen TV, fridge, microwave, ironing board and iron...... every amenity that you could ask for! And the bed was exceptionally comfortable!  We went for supper in Tattinger's Restaurant downstairs in the Hotel and enjoyed the Prime Rib Buffet, at a cost of $25 +/-. It was delicious. However a warning! The horse radish is very hot! Don't be like me and assume it's the regular fare! It is not!!! But the Yorkshire Pudding was an added bonus. I haven't had that in a long time.   We had come for a celebration that was held in a Banquet Room downstairs. My compliments to the Staff for the excellent and attentive service and the friendly faces that we met at every turn!

Our Corporate rate was $109 CDN/night. I was not impressed.  Yes, there is ample parking but that's about it as far as positive comments. We were booked into the second floor of the rear section - an older, two story, motel-like part of the hotel. Now, it's only one floor up and I would not normally complain but there is no elevator to that floor. Annoying when I've got a large, wheeled suitcase (for my 4 day stay) two laptops, shoes and jackets. At the end of the day, I just want to go straight to my room in one easy step. Now, the next problem starts - I can't get into the room. Long story short, went back to the front desk for new swipe keys.   Next evening after a long day of work, my co-worker, who stayed across the hall, could not access his room. He had to go all the way to the front desk for a replacement set of swipe cards. Staff said he must have kept the cards too close to his cell 'phone. Day after that, it was my turn again - no swipe card access. Called front desk from my co-worker's room and has them come up to me with a new set of cards. Fellow that arrived suggested that I might have kept the cards too close to my cell 'phone EXCEPT, I don't have a cell 'phone with me on this trip. When pressed, they agreed they were having 'some issues' with the system.  Yes, this is an older place that has seen better days. Within a very short distance, just across the highway, are two much nicer places I've stayed in previously and reviewed here on Trip Advisor. Both are a more pleasant option and all are similarly priced.  Anything else? On the plus side, they do still have the old, traditional Holiday Inn heated bathroom floor. There is also the option of fresh air from the opening patio doors but the sound of the highway traffic soon takes the pleasure out of that.",3,negative

Bit confused what the person a few posts below me saw to describe this as a $69 hotel - for $110+tax on Canada day weekend, you don't get much better value than this. By no means is it in the sub $100 category and I've stayed in worse places for much more expensive in Canada and around the world.

170768880,barrie/ca/154980/181979/170768880.html,Holiday Inn Barrie Hotel &amp; Conference Centre,"We arrived for a wedding on August long weekend. We spent 2x longer on the road than usual with a small toddler due to holiday traffic. Needless to say, a long trip that was exhausting! We needed to get to our room ASAP to get ready for the wedding (it was just after 2pm, which is before regular check in time). Wedding started at 4pm, so needed to start getting ready as shuttle busses were starting at 3pm. So had an hour to get ready if room was ready (would of been nice if this was made a priority by the hotel, as this was a reserved block of rooms for the wedding). Anyways, line up to check-in was small, however it was extremely slow. it took 20 minutes to get to staff at desk and I was turned away due to my spouse's name being on the reservation, and not mine (this was a slap to the face in today's world! How about just making sure he signed in also after me to make sure all was ""kosher"" instead?. Problem solve people, don't start off on a difficult note). I was not allowed to sign in for us. I asked if it was going to take a long time for him to wait to sign in too once we switched out in the vehicle (since our child was in there) and then rudely told that our room technically shouldn't be ready until 3 pm anyway. This was a disappointing first encounter with staff. Very unfriendly, unforgiving of the paperwork rules and not compassionate with our needs and long travel time. Look, I understand policies and rules and I am an employee in the customer service industry too (including experience working in hotels and spas), so I know how it works. But there is a way of conveying this in a manner that is welcoming, caring and less abrasive. This was our place away from home for the night, and this thought would go far if on the minds of front desk staff when choosing their words, tone and method of applying rules and policies. As for the room, it was okay. Pretty clean and suitable for our family of 3. It would of been nice to hear from front desk staff to not unload until my spouse signed the paperwork, or for them to have mentioned that our room was at the back of the hotel where we could drive to our door opposed to unload at the front, re-load and find this out the hard way (yes there is a dinky sign at the front that got easily missed, and not just by us!). Since the initial interaction was not that great, this was an opportunity to save us time and feel like we were being taken care of with information to help us opposed to just letting us find out on our own, and increasing our level of frustration. I was also disappointed to find the fridge in our room not turned on. This was frustrating too as we had a lot of food to keep cold, such as milk for the toddler, snacks, etc. So it took a long time to get it cold and I had to worry about the food spoiling. I understand conservation of energy, however it is a huge inconvenience when you are depending on using it and it is not ready.  I also found the waiting staff at breakfast time difficult to understand our needs and unclear with seating. We had made arrangements with other wedding guests and family to meet up for breakfast. All the tables had reserved signs on them and the waiting staff (one male) was difficult in understanding how we wanted to try and start an area that had room for others to join us. Again, staff did not comprehend the needs of wedding guests who had reserved a block of rooms with them and perhaps would like to be around each other! In conclusion, I would not return to this hotel. I prefer to feel appreciated and cared for when away from home. I have to say that some staff were friendly though (one female and housekeeping staff acknowledged us with hello's and smiles! as well a waitress was very nice with looking into our food requests).

I'll preface this review by saying I wasn't at the hotel much and didn't use any of the facilities besides parking and my room.  The hotel is very easy to drive to, as it's right off the 400. Check in was quick and friendly, and I was able to make arrangements for my boyfriend to pick up a room key in my absence, as he was arriving the next day.  I had booked this hotel with Priceline and had no issues at all regarding my reservation. The only thing was that I was given 2 double beds and was told that's all they had. I would have preferred a single queen or king, but it wasn't a huge deal. It was a busy weekend in Barrie so it was understandable.  The front desk employee had given me 2 cards but when I got around to the other side of the parking lot and hauled all my stuff out of the car, I realized neither key card would open the door. I tried another door, same thing. As I had been driving for 4+ hours, I really needed to use the washroom and this was very frustrating. Another guest came along and I was able to get in, but when I tried the doors again later that night, same thing. It took 2 trips to the front desk, and I got the impression the employee didn't believe the cards wouldn't work. He sent a security guard with me and after ""fixing"" the key card a second time, I was finally able to get in. It was just a lot of hassle for something that should work right the first time.  The room itself was nice. The room was clean and the bed was comfortable. There was lots of space to put suitcases, etc. There wasn't really a desk, just a table and comfy chair. I appreciated the mini fridge which worked great. Nice and cold, unlike so many other hotel mini fridges!  For the most part, the hallways were pretty quiet. My room faced the outdoor pool but I never heard any noise from it. The room also had a balcony which I would have enjoyed had I been in the room more.  The WiFi worked well and I'm pretty sure there was an ethernet connection too, for those without WiFi.  Being the weekend of the civic holiday and Kempenfest, the parking lot was about 80% full when I would return at night, but I never had a problem getting a spot. I had heard that other hotels that weekend had cars parking on the grass. I was pleased that the Holiday Inn was either not full, or handles higher capacities very well.  Although I didn't get a chance to try out the pool, fitness centre, or restaurant, I was very pleased overall with the Holiday Inn and wouldn't hesitate to book here again the next time I'm in Barrie.",4,positive

Good front desk staff (sometimes too busy to answer the phone but business is hopping at this place)  No safe in rooms and no DVD player so just keep that in mind when you go there.   There is also a very nice indoor pool.   This was all a very positive experience and I would recommend this hotel to anyone. We'll be back.  P.S. Hotel is a short walk from Barrie Burger on Essa Rd. GREAT, cheap bacon and eggs. Worth the walk and it is an all-day breakfast.

The front desk staff were nice, and the guys came pretty quickly to fix our slow-draining shower. The breakfast, if you so choose to have the price of it included in your daily room rate, is phenomenal. By far the best breakfast at a hotel I've encountered! There are two pools, an outdoor and an indoor, which were relatively quiet when we were there.  The rooms are a bit older than you'd expect, especially when they claim to have been ""newly renovated"". But honestly, the beds were comfortable, the breakfast was good, the bathroom was spacious and clean. You need to make your own sofa bed, which I didn't mind.  There apparently, over the last month or so, has been an issue with someone pulling the fire alarm in the middle of the night. In our case, at 3 in the morning! It only happened once, and it really wasn't the hotels fault. But, know that the front desk staff has acknowledged that it has happened before.  The location, if you have a car, is awesome. Right off the 400. However, if you're on foot, the only places nearby are a Timmies, a Sushi place, and a Wendy's just down the street. No shopping, unless you want to have a good trek up Essa to get to it.  But I will definitely come here again in the future!",4,positive

Jennie was our server in the restaurant,and she was very efficient, and was a great sport.We had a banquet on Sunday night and everything was beyond our expectations.

We arrived and we noticed the nice hotel-looking tower of rooms but also an 'L' shaped 3-storey bank of rooms surrounding the pool and courtyard. Unfortunately that’s where my room was located. Some people do enjoy a room on the floor lever, easy access etc. I am not one of those people. We entered the room, and it was a little worn-out and undesirable (plus next to the ice machine and entryway) However the saving grace was we went right back to the front desk and asked for something in the tower instead. We got a room in the tower, (4th floor) at the same price and only gave up a king size bed for a queen. This room was much nicer with a nicer view and no chance of people walking by our room.   So if planning a visit make sure to ask for a tower room instead of the, for lack of a better term, motel room.

The hotel itself has a very odd layout and unless you are an executive tower guest you take the stairs, yes even to the third floor. The rooms are clean and spacious enough. I enjoyed having a balcony even though it was too cold to use it. The hotel soap/shampoo etc is awful (very drying on the skin) so pack your own. The bed is very comfortable but the pillows are half the size of a standard pillow-very odd. The tv offers a good range of stations and there is free internet. The food at the restaurant is okay, nothing too special. A co worker ordered a pizza that came out burnt. The rest of us had to wait almost an hour for our food and we were the only people in the place at the time. Every employee is very nice, polite and willing to help with any situation. Thankfully the room came with a hairdryer and ironing board. The ""gift shop"" is really more of a snack shop since there aren't any gifts per say, unless you like to give your kid hairspray when you get home.

I enjoyed the swimming pool, however it appears as though the gym area is open to members of the community as well. This made it very difficult to get in to do any exercise, unless I went early in the morning.   The rooms have small fridges, which means you can buy some snacks or items for breakfast instead of spending money on a buffet. That being said, they unplug the fridges and you need to plug it in yourself. Mine was heavy, and while I managed to move it somewhat, I couldn't find the plug nor the outlet, and looking at how grimy the back of the fridge was, I wasn't going to go hunting. It was cool enough outside so my balcony doubled as a fridge.  While it sounds like others have enjoyed the food, I can honestly say that this was one of the worst hotel restaurants I have ever visited. I was in the bar side, so I'm not sure if this made any difference. The options were unappetizing and greasy looking at best, and when my beef stroganoff came, it was essentially over-cooked spaghetti with chewy beef and rancid mushrooms. After taking two bites, I was done. Given the other unappealing options, I chose to leave and find dinner elsewhere. I had already tempted fate once.

How is this any different than a corporate event or wedding etc., where people rent the room and have alcohol. You accommodated another hockey team with 2 rooms and they were consuming alcohol - inconsistent message.

We were told we would not be able to rent a hospitality suite in September when we booked and that the policy was not to rent to sports teams. Two other teams staying in the hotel were provided with hospitality suites. Kids were given mixed messages over the weekend about what they were allowed to do and not to do. We have always brought food in for the kids to defer costs and this presented a problem for the hotel. Other teams were in halls drinking and were allowed to stay in halls - just overall inconsistent messaging and felt like we were being chastised the entire weekend.

I felt that the rooms provided our group was nice and cozy. The staff was very friendly and accommodated my requests. The hotel had an indoor pool for our use as well as a restaurant and lounge on property. We had breakfast in the dining room and it was delicious. It’s a shame that when some parents don’t get their way while attending these tournaments that they become aggressive. I can appreciate the situation the hotel is in. They have these meeting rooms which they rent out for meetings and I am sure the last thing they need are kids playing hockey and damaging them. I have travelled for hockey with three kids. Some hotels have an older room which we can use and others don’t. I feel that quite a few of the parents on these trips take advantage of the hotels and use the weekend as an excuse to party. When my team had inquired about a meeting room for our team it was explained that that the rooms are licensed and that we would not be permitted to bring in our own alcohol as it is against the law. Well that make sense to me as I know I can’t bring my own booze into a licensed bar or restaurant so why would I here. We decided to take the pizza package that they offered which was a great deal. We were allowed to use the room for two hours and the hotel provided the pizza and pop for the team. It was perfect for us as we didn’t have to organize a restaurant and had a place to gather for a period. I can see why they don’t want to rent the rooms out just for someone to party in. it was a great weekend and I would return.,5,positive

We had booked the party room from 6 to 10 pm on the Saturday night but stayed much longer and they didn't have a problem with that.

The last time we stayed, we were stunned to receive an invitation to a Manager's Cocktail party. Never before has that happened to us in a Canadian hotel so we were delighted by it. This is typical of the way Mr. Buckle strives to make his guests feel welcome and appreciated. Today when we were checking in, he happened to be walking through the lobby. When he saw me, he came over and gave me a hug. I told him we were staying but on our way to the Caribbean for a Big-0 birthday of my husband. A few hours later, there was a knock at the door and in walked one of the chefs and a waitress with a plate of warm cookes (one of which had a lit candle) and another plate of delicious, beautifully arranged fresh fruit. They even sang 'Happy Birthday"". This lovely touch was initiated by the General Manager Mr. Buckle. Not only is he an exceptional host, he is charming and a hunk! lol  My hubby enjoyed the hot tub, which was truly hot (the way they are supposed to be.)

From the front desk person @ check in to the restaurant hosts of the hotel, all, really presented themselves as though they wanted you there. Though it was a business experience they made you feel as guests.  The informal 'guest' reception on Tuesday evening was thoughtful and generous on part of the hotel. It certainly was a gesture of 'good will'.  All round good experience @ a very cold and stormy week in Barrie, Ontario.

Staff were lovely and the hotel had lots of facilities that made it a pleasant stay - pool, gym, restaurant and in a good location just off the 400 and next to a Tim Hortons (amazing coffee and doughnuts, needs to come to the UK!) and a pizza hut.  The hotel was an odd shape and walking was a must to anywhere so maybe not great to someone with walking difficulties.  Rooms had lovely comfortable beds, sofa, fridge and coffee making facilities. Bathrooms were small but again fine for short stays. Unfortunately we moved room after our first night as we wanted 2 adjoining rooms and they put us next to the laundry which drove me crazy every morning from 6.30-7am - I'm a light sleeper!

I found her to be very impersonal, it was if I was bothering her sitting in the Bar, interrupting her newspaper reading or crossword puzzle / tv watching.

Have conference area sections and low level 2 story building attached. Right off the hwy so good accessibility. Unfortunately if you are staying in the tower as I did, and there's no parking in the front and side, it's a real long walk from parking in the back of hotel and walking around with heavy luggage through the snow. I kept looking for a back door which there is one but it is only to the conference ctr and low rise building of rooms, not attached to the front. It was hard to see in the dark how the whole hotel was laid out but a connecting hallway or indoor walkway from the back door to the tower would have bee appreciated especially in this cold weather and for my own safety. Amenities are good in the tower rooms , only thing missing would be a kettle and maybe a few assortments of herbal teas organic would be a nice touch. Times are changing and people are trying to live healthier, having a small option in room would be really nice especially at $130/ night midweek in Barrie.  Other than those two issues, nice place clean and happy not to be bombarded with perfume air freshener sprays in lobby like some other hotels, I have allergies to those chemicals. Not healthy for anyone to breathe them in they are lung irritants and hormone disrupters , so please keep the scent out.   Thank you",4,positive

193691007,barrie/ca/154980/181979/193691007.html,Holiday Inn Barrie Hotel &amp; Conference Centre,"In today's era of ""me, myself & I"" it is very difficult to find employees who truly ""want"" to give to others and serve others without the attitude of resentment or underlying anger for a job that they are employed to do. It seems that there are ""some"" individuals who want the pay check but not the work. We've all been served by individuals of this nature when on vacation or on business trips.   The hospitality business is indeed one that will either sink or swim based on their employees' disposition towards serving others while staying at their hotel that they are employed by. And with this statement in mind...I most certainly give this Holiday Inn in Barrie a 5 star! The pool room, the lounge, the on-site restaurant, etc..are not the qualities that come to my mind when I confidently give a 5 star...but rather the employees. They are the ones who are the ""5 stars"".  Let me openly admit I am a princess when it comes to traveling and cleanliness is #1, attentive service #2, and quality food #3. And each of these criteria where mastered beyond expectation! My husband and I typically stay only at 5 star hotels and even pay extra for ""gold floors"" such as the Fairmont, but sadly, our last experience was terrible and was noisier (till 2 am!) then our budget hotel stays that we always attend at while on our son's hockey tournaments. If any of you good old Canadian Hockey Moms & Dads know...they can get pretty rowdy in the halls. And yet while I stayed here for another hockey tournament...I was clearly but kindly informed at the front desk that there was a 10 o'clock curfew for noise levels. I am the team's trainer and I emailed all of parents and notified them of the curfew time and insisted they all abide, however there was another team also staying on the same floor (I'm sure they group all hockey teams together to ensure a more pleasant stay for non-hockey team guests on other floors) that were rowdy and it was past curfew time. I simply placed one call to the front desk and literally before I finished my sentence....she had reassured me that security would be right down to address the issue and she even added and reassured me that this is why they pay for security to ensure everyone has a pleasant stay. ...Are you kidding me!!! Wow! What great ""professional"" service!  I called down 3 times at the Fairmont only to give up calling at 2 am, where as here at this Holiday Inn, in less then 5 mins. I heard only silence in the hall. I was so overly impressed and thankful because our little guys had an early morning game the following day. I have had the pleasure of speaking to the young lady at the front desk on numerous occasions for a variety of needs and each and every time Stephanie was beyond pleasant, cheerful and extremely professional. Amazing person to work the front desk where first impressions are made...super choice with Stephanie!  The following morning we arranged to have the team met at their on-site restaurant for breakfast. My family and I had stayed here in the past and I was always very pleased with their cleanliness of their hotel and their food. This was the reason I suggested to our manger to book this hotel for our tournament. And once again, I was not disappointed. The quality of food was again exceptional... versus the several other hockey tournament hotels. For the most part I feel insulted at most hotel restaurants when on tournaments. There has been so many other hotels that I have felt as though they tried not to serve us any ""real"" food but only bare basics and low quality. However this establishment truly ""cares"" about satisfying your body & mind. The quality of the breakfast buffet is more then the basics. They serve hot scrambled eggs, Santa Fe eggs, sausage, bacon, hash browns, waffles, french toast, pancakes, assorted breads, cereals, porridge, fruits, etc.. Honestly, everything you could want for breakfast and more. And they even changed it up the following day with equally fabulous food! All very hot and fresh and ample supply. They never ran out of food or left anything empty. (The Fairmont Royal York did) The food server constantly came by our table and asked us if we needed anything, cleared our dirty plates promptly, refilled beverages promptly and even accommodated my request of glasses of waters for each of my hockey boys to hydrate them prior to our game. With a smilie literally on her face, she promptly served them all without even a fraction of delay. And keep in mind, Adrienne, our server, had 15 families PLUS other non-hockey related guests to serve and was equally serving them all with exceptional professionalism and quality. My husband & I are both business owners and we both equally seen the qualities of this lady to be management quality without a doubt! As mentioned previously...she loved to serve others and was pleased to do so and was not in the least giving minimal effort. She appeared to be new because she seemed so overly happy, giving, attentive to detail, gracious, kind, friendly, etc... usually all qualities of new employees but apparently ADRIENNE has been with this hotel for a year at least....amazing Adrienne!!!! I was so impressed with her that it prompt me to stop my day at work in my business and contact the hotel manager Don Buckle and praise him for an exceptional employee as well as the entire staff and service we received while staying at his hotel. I would also like to add at this time that I had left a message to speak with Mr. Buckle on his voice mail with only my name and contact number...no detail regarding what I wanted to speak about...and he equally returned my call promptly and I might say, very happy and friendly. We spoke for some time and I can certainly see how his mannerism and professionalism has rubbed off on his employees. I can only imagine from my personal experience that he has made this establishment a ""happy place"" for his employees to work at. That is a praise to be certainly proud of Mr. Don Buckle! My hat goes off to you sir.  I also needed to contact the ""lost & found"" department today in housekeeping as I thought I left a shopping bag of new items in our room. I left a message and within less then an hour my call was promptly returned. I found my item here at home after I shortly had left my message but the service in EVERY department...from hotel manger, front desk, food service, security, housekeeping....cleanliness of the rooms (I asked for hypo allergic room), pool hours and cleanliness of pool area, etc.. Just every single aspect of this hotel was nothing short of  ""Old-Fashion 1st Class""!  Thank you each and everyone one of you for taking pride in your job and taking pride in representing yourself! You should all be VERY proud! As well as your family members. Thank you!  Sincerely, Mrs. Carol-Lynn Hawes",5,positive

Pro's:   - Front lobby staff were awesome!  - Pizza and pop deal was great!  Con's:   - One of our chairs in the room had stains on it (not sure what it was and not sure I want to find out).  - My entire family was woken up at 5:00 am by security yelling at the guy across from us telling him to keep quiet and complaining about how many people were in his room. Finally the security guy left and I fell back to sleep.  - We were all woken up again at 5:20 by the same security guy yelling at the same guy but this time the security guy had the police with him and the guy ended up being evicted from his hotel room. We ended up staying up as none of us could fall back asleep.  Kind of an oxymoron when you think of it... We never even heard the guy across the hall from us... the ONLY person we could hear was the security guard yelling.   I complained to the front lobby staff and they gave us a measly 25% discount... I think it should have definitely been more of a discount as we were exhausted the next day for the drive home and my 5 year old son was tired and cranky which made it for an even longer drive home...,1,negative

The stairwell had an unusual and not pleasant odour to it and the rooms are very dated and worn out. The chairs are strategically placed to cover the stains on the carpet.

How poorly? I walk into the room I was given and was overwhelmed by the strong smell of urine! I immediately ask a co-worker to come into the room to confirm before I went back to the front desk to change rooms. Staff was apologetic and gave me another room. This room was urine odour free (Yay!) but was a bit musty. I decided to grit my teeth and bear it. The front desk staff delivered a snack tray to me an hour later as an apology - I thanked them for it.   What bothers me is that it seems the corporate message of The Holiday Inn Experience is really just a title on a webpage. The promise of clean, modern and safe hotel rooms do not work out in practice. This particular Holiday Inn obviously has no quality control on the status of rooms. If they did, how could a room smelling of urine be given out?   Not sure of the origin of the smell but I would assume that this was an incident from the previous room user. Why there was no policy in place for the hotel staff to report or resolve this BEFORE the room was rented again is beyond me.   Is this an isolated incident? Probably, but is makes me wary of the quality control of the entire hotel chain and if a huge, obvious problem like this was 'missed'. How can any of us be sure that a normal, thorough cleaning is being done between clients.   I'm sure this review will bring the usual corporate-speak message of 'ensuring the best for clients' and some sort of apology but it will not persuade me to stay in this hotel or probably any Holiday Inn again.

We were put in a ground floor unit on the courtyard but unfortunately, the room did not meet my expectations for a Holiday inn. The room was run down and tired looking and seriously in need of an update. Not sure if this was the case for all rooms, or just the pet rooms, but I suspect the entire wing we stayed in was the same. The outdoor pool was closed (in June) which was an interesting time of the year to do maintenance, but there was an indoor pool available as well. The bar and restaurant were nice but I found it interesting that there was only one breakfast voucher provided with the room with others available to purchase for $10.

Had to climb stairs with baggage (which I already had to drag through the hotel) Finally found my room. Smelled of cigarette smoke quite badly - I specifically requested a non-smoking room and stated in my reservation that I have allergies. Room reminded me of a strip motel type room (both in décor and style). Complained to the manager on duty that smoke was filtering in to my room from upstairs - she explained there is a smoking area above my room. Did not offer to switch rooms for me. Cleaning lady offered to Febreeze my room and squirted Febreeze at me in the doorway. I think they thought it was funny. Febreeze makes no difference if you cannot breathe.

The walls aren't very soundproof - we could hear everything going on in the hallway. I booked a wheelchair accessible room and was annoyed that there is a lift that must be operated by management to get from the lobby to the level of the restaurant and the door we stayed in. That also meant that we had to move our car around to the back to park closer to the room - it's great you can park close to the room, but annoying to have to park one place to check in and another to get to your room. The accessible bathroom had some major flaws: once seated on the bench in the roll in shower, you can't reach the controls to turn on the water.

I stayed one very humid night in September - so humid the HVAC was cranked when I walked in the room to keep it at a reasonable humidity level. My first view out of the room's window into the courtyard was two overweight guys sitting with their shirts off drinking beer - no wonder business travellers drink. The room was a classic box with two beds, a TV (flat screen), fridge and microwave. The fridge was turned off, supposedly to conserve electricity, but that means you have to wait for it to cool before you can use it. They know you are coming so turn on the fridge. The owners didn't spend much on decor as there were a couple of small prints but otherwise bare walls. The HVAC unit is probably original construction and as such, roared like a jet engine primed for take off. It was virtually impossible to sleep without A) earplugs or B) turning the AC off and sweltering. There is not much for food in the vicinity of the hotel so I tried the restaurant on site. I ordered a dinner salad and got a bowl of lettuce. I wanted to stay at the bar afterwards to see the end of the Jays game but since the bar closed at 10PM, was shooed out before the game ended. I also used the fitness room in the AM after a fitful sleep with the AC/turbine engine off. OK assortment of equipment fitted into the available space - no towels at 6AM though. The are lots of properties in Barrie now to choose from. This one might be good if you are in the Holiday Inn points program and it gets you an upgraded room. The basic rooms are plain although updated relics from 30 years ago. You can park near your room though as the (free) parking extends around the hotel.

Was really looking forward to getting in the pool but by the time we hiked to the room with our bags neither of us could bear the thought of doing that walk twice more (to and from pool)... Carrying suitcases up approximately 20 steps in the morning was not fun...You can avoid the stairs by cutting across open lawn area that undulates in every different direction but is fairly flat... Carpets were filthy pulling away from wall. Bed was reasonably comfortable until 130 am when, what sounded like, an entire bus load of partiers returned... Banging doors, yelling/talking incredibly loud and singing in the court yard... Might not have minded that if it had been in tune...bottom line...

Was given a room and vague direction through the hotel. Not that receptionist was busy, there was no one around, she was just that helpful. Actually this hotel has an executive tower (which is seen on all pictures) and strip motel attached to (no pictures at all). After long walk and stairs up and down I finally made it to my room which turned to be on the ground with easy access from the parking. I guess the receptionist could have made my life easier has she mentioned this detail. I got in the room with smoke smell and dirty sheets. There was hair from all parts of body all over the sheet. I called to complain and a manager came to inspect, confirmed what I saw was what she saw so I was given another room. Not less disgusting, but at least no visible hair. I had no choice but to sleep there since I was with my dog and was almost midnight. Next day morning I asked to be moved to a room in the executive tower hoping at least there to get a decent room. I was told I can't get a room there because these rooms are not dog friendly. I arranged to leave my dog with my friends in Barrie, and got a room in the executive tower. The peak was that after 3 calls they didn't help me get my charger that was left in the 2nd room. I called 2 times in the afternoon, and went 2 times in person the next day to the front desk. Any time I was given different answers and excuses, but not the charger. I had to go to the room myself to get it.

But my main concern was the safety of the room - the only light for the main room came from the standard lamp at the far end so you had to leave the light on when leaving knowing that you were coming back in the dark. But of course the light got turned off when the room was cleaned so when you returned that part of the room was in complete darkness. The light switch when you entered was for the bathroom and mirror. Fortunately, I'm not scared of the dark but I suspect that many might be. Just a thought for you to consider but you might need to take a torch.
 
 
 Room Tip:  Ask if there are any junior ice hockey teams stopping on the floor and then avoid.

We arrived just at our before 10PM. Waitress decided the bar was closed even though she had just delivered 4 beers to a table.

Staff wasn't very friendly and helpful during our two days stay at this place. Also, there was no place made available to us. If I am not mistaken, there were at least 3 different hockey teams of different ages staying at this hotel at the same time, and all of them were holding their pizza parties in the hallways or rooms since no rooms were made available without adding an extra cost to teams.  Rooms are outdated and not the cleanest. And last comment, rate wasn't a great deal. I found better rate online, but they told me that I couldn't access that rate since we were under a contract. we paid 119.00+ tax and found a rate of 116.00 plus cashback on ebates.

Things were clean and in decent shape for the most part. A few cosmetic issues but nothing that made us concerned or really put a damper on our stay. We enjoyed the pool, though the whirlpool was out of service while we there. Buddy, our large puppy (pets must be under 100lbs to stay we were told) had a good time and we didn't hear a lot of barking in the night, even though we knew there were other dogs staying in adjacent rooms.   The only really disappointing part of the stay was the lack of a continental breakfast. The restaurant does have breakfast deals for the kids, at the time we stayed the kids could order off the children's breakfast menu for free as long as mom an/or dad ordered an entree. We knew that there was no continental breakfast so we just planned around it.   If I had to sum our stay up... pricey for the experience but not a bad stay on the whole.   Average is probably a good word. We preferred the other Holiday Inn in Barrie but our hands were tied by the dog needing to come along for the trip.",3,negative

To get to the room front the front desk though you have to walk down a corrider that felt like you were walking in a finished basement with the ceiling so low that I could touch it just by raising my hand. Once in the room, everything you could want was there, a small refrigerator, coffee maker, iron, blow dryer, and plenty of soft fluffy towels. The only issue I had with the room was the whiny noise of the refrigerator fan. I unplugged it from the wall and was able to get a quiet night's sleep. The room was updated except for the bathroom. It looked like it had not been updated since the 1980s. It was clean but not modern with some cracks evident on the tiles. The shower offered pleny of hot water and good pressure.  Although most everyone at the hotel was very nice and service was good, I did have one exception. I ordered coffee and a dessert at the restaurant one night and was kept waiting for twenty minutes with my lukewarm coffee. The waitress never came back after bringing me the coffee so I just got up and left.

When we checked in we were given our room number and we unloaded the car and headed to the room. Once we were on our way with our stuff we were THEN informed by the front desk that we weren't in the main building and had to load everything back up and drive around the back of the property. As we were there for a wedding with a full load for the event it was very frustrating. Once we got to the room we found out our building had no elevator access and absolutely stank. I didn't even know hotels in Canada still had smoking rooms but this hotel intermingles the smoking and non-smoking rooms so the whole ""motel"" building was awful smelling with very dated carpeting that looked rough. Upon driving back to the front desk and speaking with a manager we were finally put up in the tower and able to unload everything we needed.   Overall I would not recommend this hotel due to the age, condition and accessibility of most of it. Other members of the party in for the wedding stayed at Comfort Inn literally a stones throw away and had good rooms for more than 1/2 the price we paid.

We had an executive king room, with a nice desk and a mid-sized recliner. The room itself appeared to be updated, but you could tell the hotel is a bit older, with older color schemes in the halls.  The front desk personnel, housekeeping, and various staff we encountered were all friendly and service oriented.  We did not use the restaurant or the the swimming pool, but from our balcony, it appeared that the pool was both indoor and outdoor; that you could swim from the indoor pool to the outdoor one.

It's an older hotel and most hotels have very small pools so having one inside and out is rare.   Outdoor Pool: Was what we had hoped for a large pool with an actual 8 foot deep end and with patio loungers around 2 sides of the perimeter. In decent repair.  Our Room: We were in 1508 (a tower room with no balcony) which overlooks the pool. A fully renovated King room which we quite liked especially the bed and the bedding.   Downsides mostly minor, switching to heat from the under window heat/cool until made the room smell like a hairdryer likely due to dust on the heating coils which you can't avoid. And a slight smokey smell in the bathroom door which we think was coming from the air vent in the upper corner of the bathroom. It wasn't persistent but was noticeable on entering the bathroom at times. The rest of the room smelt fresh and again it's likely and older building issue.  Not a 5 in our books but a solid 4 and worth it over the value brands which make up most of Barrie hotels.",4,positive

I have to say this is probably one of the worst experiences I ever had. When I checked in, the women at the counter was friendly. While I was checking in, a person interrupted and said their key didn't work. The hotel is large and I was told to park in the back near my room. I took all my luggage in, get into the hotel, get to the room and surprise - the key isn't working for me either. I tracked all the way to the desk, down the stairs with all my stuff (for some reason there was no elevator service to my floor), and got a new key. I get in the room and there is a note saying water will be shut off every day while I'm in the hotel from 9-2. Why would you put someone in a room where there is no water for half the day? The next morning I woke up at 8:00 to the loudest banging and construction noise I ever heard right upstairs from me. I rushed into the shower hoping they wouldn't shut the water off on me. I only stayed here two nights, but thank goodness it wasn't any longer. The last day I woke up, earlier than I would have liked to avoid having water shut off again. When I called to check out, people usually ask how your stay was and I was ready to tell them. However, the only question I was asked was ""did you drink the $5 bottle of water in your room?"", which I answered no and left as quickly as possible. I used the sliding glass door to bring stuff out to my car and the door came off the track, which I struggled to fix so I could lock it back up. Bottom line is check ahead of time if your hotel is being renovated, and if it is stay somewhere else. I've never had renovations so negatively affect me. And for the size of this hotel, renovated wings should be shut down- or at least you shouldn't put your best customers into them. As a priority club member who stays at Holiday Inn all the time, I got nothing here - no upgrade, no breakfast, crappy service, not even running water. I would never stay here again - even when the renovations are done - If you like Holiday Inn, stay at the Holiday Inn Express down the road which is much better.",2,negative

I was given an ""executive"" room. The room was shabby and not very clean. In addition, there was no hot water in the shower. When I let them know at check out, the staff apologized. I don't know if the big renovation is complete or not. If it is, then I would say they took a pretty cheap route! The room was re-done on the surface but it's old and obviously in disrepair.

They close the outdoor pool at 9:00 pm or if there is a chance of rain!!!!!! However, they leave the indoor pool open until 10:00 pm. The indoor pool is very small and so hot inside that it is unbearable for parents that are watching their children. There are no chairs and it is like torture standing in there watching your children. They only allow 20 people in the indoor pool at a time which creates a line-up whenever the outdoor pool is closed (which seemed to be every time we tried to go swimming). We even asked if they could open the outdoor pool past 9:00 pm to alleviate the line-up and allow more children the chance to swim and they said they couldn't do anything about it.

We had two adults, a senior and two kids in our party. We reserved a non-smoking room with two double beds and a cot. When we arrived the clerk at the front desk Husein told us there were no more rooms available and after a very long wait he finally gave us a room. We had to go up stairs, a long hallway and again more stairs with our luggage. This was very difficult for the senior in our party and we were shocked there were no elevators. The key did not work in the room so security came with us and opened the room at 1:30am only to find it was occupied, shocking the woman who had been sleeping in the room. After another long wait we were finally brought to a room that had a King size bed and a couch. With the cot we had enough space but the room was horribly cramped the couch extremely uncomfortable and we had zero floor space to walk around. We were given a smoking room and it reeked of smoke. In order to get some sleep, we had to close the window due to the noise from the parking lot and highway and suffered terribly from the stench of the smoke.

73572298,barrie/ca/154980/181979/73572298.html,Holiday Inn Barrie Hotel &amp; Conference Centre,"We stayed here as wedding guests for a wedding that was held at the Holiday Inn. Our experience from the beginning was great. The staff in the restaurant were amazing! We checked in with no problems, and the front desk staff were very helpful. The room was clean and a lot larger then we expected. The beds were comfortable, and the noise from the hall was negligable. The only issue that we had was that our travelling companions required a handicap spot for parking.   The hotel only has two spots, both of which were used when we required one. One of the vehicles did not have a disabled pass. Our travelling companions have a heart problem (less than a year ago had had a quad. bi-pass done) and with the heat outside, required a parking spot close to the hotel. When we brought this up to the staff at the front desk, we were originally told that they would look into it. One of the cars in the parking space did not have a permit. In Ontario, you require a permit. When we approached the same individual again a couple of hours later, we were told that they had decided ""not to disrupt a guest for our convenience"", and that ""they decide who gets to park in the disabled spots and that permits don't matter"". We were then told that if we wanted to call the police, that we could but that they would not. They were rude and completely un-sympathetic. When we informed some of the other staff about the situation, they told us they'd inform the manager. The next day, the other staff we talked to told us that the people using the parking space did not have a permit, but had appropriate documentation (which is not legal, regardless of documentation) and then proceeded to tell us that the individual was obese. When we checked out, the individual that owned the car was not obese, as they were checking out at the same time. So I'm not sure why the hotel staff was lying about the situation, and why they did not adhere to the law with regards to parking in disabled spots, or why the manager did not approach us personally to appologize for the rude behaviour of their staff.   So even though we had a good experience in the beginning, we were completely disappointed with their complete lack of compassion. Our travelling companions rarely travel because of health issues, and this experience shocked them.",3,negative

If you have mobility issues that make it impossible to negotiate a long staircase, to get to and from various areas of the hotel (for example, from the tower rooms to the restaurant, or from the other rooms to the lobby or pool) you must use an ancient service elevator. The problem with this elevator is that you can't just push a button and get on it...you have to get a member of the staff to go get a key to the elevator, and they have to unlock it for you. This means waiting for them to go find the key, or find someone who has the key. Then you have to go through the same rigamarole on the way back.

My daughter booked the hotel for us via Hotwire... We had stayed at the Holiday Inn on Fairview before, but they have accessability issues (I'll get to that) - and so we thought Hotwire was worth a try, even if we got the same hotel - maybe this time we'd have a better room.  Hotwire booked the hotel, my daughter called and asked for them to change the booking to a wheelchair accessable room - they did so without any problems. Great!  When we got to the hotel, my husband (who is not wheelchair bound, but does have movement issues... Luckily so - as the room had too many benches/desks to fit a wheelchair through past the bed) found that the chair in the shower stall had a used bar of soap on it - meaning the chair had not been cleaned since the last person's naked body sat on it. Okay, gross! There was a used bottle of shampoo on the floor of the shower. So we thought - let's call the front desk and have them re-clean the shower.   We called just before 5pm. Someone was to be up right away. By 6:30 we were going for dinner, we called again - again, shortly. We were away for 2 hours, when we got back the bathroom had been looked at (a glass on the counter was replaced) but nothing else had been touched... we now noticed an open used bottle of lotion and a large amount of hair behind the bathroom door... We went down to the front office and complained in person, no one came.  Upon turning to bed, we found a hair in our sheets... most likely the cleaning lady's - so we weren't TOO concerned.  The next morning my daughter arrived... and again asked that the bathroom be thoroughly cleaned, spelling out all the issues - we were assured as soon as the cleaning staff got in, they would service our room. We left for the day.  Returning that afternoon, the bed was made - the towels were replaced, but the shower had not been cleaned, the hair was still clumped behind the door. At this point my son in law took matters into his hands. He went down to the front desk and waited for other patrons to arrive so that he would maybe be able to SHAME the front desk into cleaning our rooms. Luckily, a cleaning lady was in the lobby and overheard the coversation and beat him back to the room. Our bathroom was finally thoroughly cleaned - taking just over 24 hours from our first complaint.  As we had booked with Hotwire, there was nothing the hotel could do... but give us a couple comp'd breakfasts. Fine. Another room would have been better - but they had no other handicap accessable rooms available!!  While I'm on the topic of accessability, there are only a few handicap parking spaces at the front of the hotel. There are several at the back door, but there aren't any push buttons to open the door at that location. Should you park at the back of the building, and need to get in - you would then have to wheel around through the parking lot (no sidewalks) down a small hill to the front door to then get in. How hard is it to put in a button at the back doors???   A simple apology would have even been nice - but we didn't even get that. Thanks a lot Holiday Inn Barrie.

Recent renovations have modernized the look of the brunch, but placed it into a somewhat cramped area, reducing the amount of food available, (but only slightly affecting the number of choices). The quality does vary slightly from week to week, from excellent to just above average. The new look is much cleaner, throughout the hotel. I attend business functions often, and have always found them well organized at this venue (the Inn, rather than Tattinger's specifically). Our family does occasionally spend a night at this hotel, both to take advantage of the pool, and also to get a 'kid free' night to ourselves. Although we have not stayed since the renovations have been completed, we have always found the rooms to be at the standard we would expect for the price range, and have never had reason to complain about the room, or the service.",4,positive

This was a trip to visit my sister in Barrie with my mom and dad. The beds were comfy, the room was clean, and there was sufficient soap and shampoo and stuff available for us.  In our travels between the car and the room, we encountered two of the cleaning ladies. Both of which smiled as we passed, greeted us, and engaged us in casual conversation. Very impressed. Great service here.  At night, my family and I wanted to share a bottle of wine. I called the front desk who informed me that security will be on the hunt for a cork screw. The security fellow popped up to our room within about ten minutes time. Prompt and efficient.  At check out, I had a little conversation with the fellow at front desk regarding the type of computer system used in the hotel. I work Night Audit at another hotel in Ottawa, so it is nice to chat a bit about the job and compare mine to another. The fellow was very pleasant, also smiled. The FOM came out as well, all smiles. Everyone here seemed naturally pleasant, nothing forced.  Breakfast was good. The omelletes were HUGE. My sister ordered the fruit breakfast, which contains an assortment of FRESH fruit, nothing canned. I was impressed. The gentleman stocking up for a lunch buffet smiled and engaged us in conversation. As did our server. Very polite, efficient, and sociable.  Overall, a pleasant experience. The only downfall of the hotel is it's maze like quality to the untrained guest. Like myself. Although, I still get lost at the Rideau Centre.",5,positive

We made arrangements with the front manager for a discount and paid by cheque when one night we arrived after work and we were locked out. We were informed at 8:00pm that we needed to pay in CASH or Credit Card or we would be locked out of our room. With confusion and tears we connacted my parents and they couldn't just give there credit card by phone (you can book and hold your room by credit card but they wouldn't except that) they had to drive 20 klm to a Holiday Inn and give them their credit card then that was faxed back to this Holiday Inn in Barrie. You must understand one very important fact here we paid cash for two weeks up until this point when they refused our cheque and requested this cash/credit card info that night our we would be locked out. If you think this was the end of this nightmare think again. While my husband was at work I was working from the hotel on my business affairs when I started to receive phone calls, not your ordinary phone calls but hang ups 20 or more in a matter of 2 hours. I even had a housekeeper in my room listening to all these calls. Then I was speaking to my husband and we could here a person listening to our conversation not just once but many times. I asked for a maintenance man to come to my room and his comments where; ""There is nothing wrong with your phone, someone has to put the calls through from the front desk and unless they hang up down at main switch board they can listen in on your calls."" So therefore if you are thinking that this hotel is run professionally think again. We are sending the Holiday Inn Head Office a detailed letter with all the approiate names attached to express our nightmare. We stayed at this Holiday Inn for 3 weeks and spent over $3,000.00 for this nighmare.",1,negative

92333954,barrie/ca/154980/181979/92333954.html,Holiday Inn Barrie Hotel &amp; Conference Centre,"My family and I recently stayed at this hotel for 4 very long days, while we were getting ready to move out of province for my husband's work. We were initially billed for our entire stay, plus the deposit a few days prior to check-in; however, when we checked in, our credit card was billed for 3 days stay, plus the deposit again. When my husband spent a very long period of time speaking to the very unhelpful and unsympathetic woman at the front desk, we were told it would be reversed. Well, it wasn't. What a mess. And we're on a budget. We need the funds on our credit card to last us for our entire travel until our new home was ready. Besides the billing 'mishap', we had a woman check-in next to us with a dog, which we have nothing against because we were travelling with our dog, as well. However, she left her dog in the room to go to some event in the hotel and this dog barked for 6 hours! After finally having enough, we called the front desk and they said they would deal with it. And they did; however, when the woman came back to her room, she brought a bunch of people with her and continued to party and get her dog barking until 3 in the morning. This completely ruined our departure for 6am the same day. There were other issues as well- the same front desk employee would put me on hold when I would call down for long periods of time. At one point, I went downstairs while I was still on hold and she was chatting it up with a fellow employee- there wasn't one customer at the front desk. What else? Too many inconsistencies. We were told initially when we booked via phone that our rate included the 'Kids Eat Free' program; however, when we got there, they said this wasn't included. (They did offer 2 free kids' breakfasts when they messed up our credit card- on the condition that we eat at the restaurant as well- no thanks.) We were told via phone that for $10, my husband and I would receive breakfast at the restaurant. We thought this was great because we would have this, the kids would have their complimentary breakfast and we would be on budget. Guess what? You guessed it- the front desk said that this would actually cost between $20 and $30.   The funny thing is, what really spoiled this stay the most was the horrible customer service from the front desk. They did nothing to make up for the inconveniences we repeatedly received each day. We received nothing but a snotty attitude.  And to cap it off? We still haven't been credited back the $150 refund to our credit card. We have since stayed at 4 hotels in 3 different provinces (no Holiday Inns thanks to this experience) and all of our refunds have been returned. I have sent to complaints via email to Holiday Inn's Customer Service and haven't received a response. The last email I sent was 10 days ago. Terrible all around.  I miss the days of good, old customer service. When you pay for a service, it should be upheld. Would I recommend this hotel to anybody? No.",1,negative

95375898,barrie/ca/154980/181979/95375898.html,Holiday Inn Barrie Hotel &amp; Conference Centre,"An overall great stay at this hotel. Highlights: location, restaurant, and front desk service. Here are the details:  LOCATION: Located directly off Hwy 401 (take Essa Rd exit) this hotel is conveniently located near shopping, gas stations, and walking distance to several restaurants (including a Mandarin directly next door and a sushi place about a 2 min walk away). We were in Barrie for a ski weekend and the hotel is about a 20-30 min drive from Mt. St. Louis/Moonstone, Horseshoe Valley and Snow Valley ski hills. Plenty of parking with several entrances so you can enter/exit close to your room.  CHECK-IN: Was extremely smooth and we were very impressed by the service we received from the youngman at the front desk. He was friendly, helpful, and set our stay off on the right foot. I hope management realizes how great this employee is! We asked if there was a microwave in our room (even though we were pretty sure their wasn't) and he informed us that there wasn't but that he could check to see if there was an extra one that could be sent up. He did so immediately and maintenance installed the microwave before we got up to our room. We were very impressed!  ROOM: The hotel is newly renovated and tastfully decorated. The standard room we were in had 2 double beds with fresh white linens and great pillows, a mini-fridge, coffee maker, etc. The room was clean and we were on the 3rd floor, so it had a nice little balcony (probably more useful in the summer but still nice).   POOL AREA: Nice pool area, clean with hot tub and sauna (nice after a long day skiing!). The fitness room is also located here and was decently equipped with a couple of cardio machines and a universal gym. The sauna could use some repairs (a few boards need replacing and the ceiling was full of dust). My main complaint about this hotel was the changerooms in the pool area. They were obviously not included in the hotel renovations and were dingy with wallpaper literally peeling off the walls. I didn't want my feet to touch the floor. Some attention needs to be paid to this area.  RESTAURANT: The restaurant/bar in the hotel was good. Our server was great and they had a varied menu. They have a prime-rib buffet on Saturday nights. We ordered off the menu and the food was very good. They also have full-menu room service and the room services prices are VERY reasonable.   OVERALL: A good stay and exactly what we were looking for. Next time we are staying in Barrie we will most likely stay at this hotel again.",4,positive

But I will only speak here for myself. My first complaint is that the hotel was close to nothing of real interest; only a few fast food restaurants. To get downtown by foot, it took you a half-hour of struggling through uncleared sidewalks.  My second complaint is the in-house restaurant, Tattinger's. Supposedly, It's the top restaurant in Barrie. However, I found it pricey, unless you ordered an appetizer, (I did that, ordering salad which, when it arrived, was so big it could have doubled for a main course.) As well, in the morning, the restaurant is set up suggesting a complementary Continental breakfast. However, when I was finished eating, I was told it was actually a $15 breakfast buffet. No indication of that anywhere in the restaurant or in hotel information. Other than that, no real complaints from me. (However, one of our group, who is legally blind, threatened to leave the restaurant when a waitress who, when asked to read the menu, (a common rrequest among blind customers in restaurants), bluntly answered she had no time for that, But finally, she did read the menu.)",4,positive

I wanted to let you know that my night Auditor (Jim), was not trying to be disrespectful when he told you to phone the police. He had tried numerous times to remove the children and parents from the room next to yours but with no success. After asking repeatedly to leave we had to phone the police. At this time we were told they were very busy and would get here as soon as possible. That was not till 5.30 am the next morning. I’m very sorry that you experienced a bad stay but we did do all that we could.   Unfortunately I can not refund you the money you spent here but I can offer you a free night voucher for a next visit. I read your email and understand that you do not want this but I’m offering it to you anyways.    Again I want you to know that we did all that we could do and that I’m very sorry you had a noisy stay. I will email you the free voucher today and you can use it the next time you are in Barrie.

My husband and I had to insist to the clerk who said that there was no manager there that week, to move rooms. My 1 yr old was crawling and the top of her feet and knees were as black as oil. The second room, my 6 yr old found a shard of glass next to the bed. We were given same style room, minus the 'kitchenette' part. But the choice of a dirty room with a kitchenette or a cleaner room without one was obvious. We were also told that this second room was booked on friday (we booked for a week at this hotel, prepaid!) so we would need to move a second time..our third room had one king and a pull out couch - SO fun when trying to get the kids to bed! We pulled out the couch and there were no blankets or sheets, I called the front desk and she told me I had to come down and get them..I went down and the maid was sitting in the lobby chair chatting it up with the front desk clerk..inconvenient or what! We had also planned on using the pool and hot tub on the last night and it was shut down .. the hot tub also had two dirty band aids sitting at its side for at least two days that we were there. We also went outisde and a bum asked if we had a smoke, I told the front clerk and she said he was a regular in all the hotels! Felt a little uneasy.

Last time we visited, we found that the pool had not been maintained as well as in the past, however this might be because of the high traffic of the summer months.

Check in was fast, they had almost out entire team together (which the kids love), gave us a room for our team pizza dinner, and tolerated loud noisy kids in the halls and the pool area.  I can't comment on the ""new tower rooms"" as we were placed in ""the traditional wing"" of the building; traditional, I guess means ""a bit old and tired"". However, the room was relatively clean and spacious, but a bit dated with older furnishings, a small tube tv, and a bit of a worn down appearance. However, the room did have a good size ""mini fridge"" and the beds and linens were nice and comfy.  The pool itself was very small, and had a unpleasant green tinge to it.  The location is convienient to #400, but there wasn't a whole lot around the hotel except for a Tim Hortons just down the street.  All in all, not a bad place, but will definitly try somewhere different the next time we are in Barrie.

The complimentary breakfast was great. It had the usual breads with butter & jellies, juices, coffee, cereals, yogurt, hard-boiled eggs and make-your-own waffle irons.   Sure, there were a couple inconveniences. I would have liked a rack for a handtowel next to the sink, and the markings on the heater/ac unit were a bit worn & so it was hard to get it adjusted.

The breakfast area is a good size with a door that opens into their small meeting room which they had setup for extra breakfast seating. There is a lot of free parking available with easy access for trucks and buses, The lobby is comfortable looking and I found the staff welcoming and easy to deal with.

On arrival we found parking easily (it's free and there were plenty of spare spaces) and the check-in staff member was friendly and helpful. I have no idea what the ""smoking"" rooms are like but the non-smoking room didn't smell at all and we couldn't smell smoke coming from anywhere else.   The room was fairly basic but clean and tidy. It had a desk, TV, free wireless internet, sofa bed, coffee maker, fridge, microwave, hairdryer and complimentary basics like coffee and shampoo. The bed was the best part of the room as it was really comfortable (had a great night's sleep!) and the bed linen was fresh and clean. The room came with complimentary continental breakfast but we chose not to have it.   The location was okay, only a $10 cab ride to the main night spots in Barrie, and the front desk staff called us a taxi that came within a couple of minutes. One thing was that, being a weekend, and having our room backed onto the next door's Travelodge outdoor area, there were a few rowdy people hanging around outside.

My husband loves the eggs, I love the baked cookies. I never eat cookies for breakfast but oh my, you have to try them out! My husband loves the pool and hot tub while I either check e-mail in the business centre or simply hang out in the breakfast room with my Playbook. We feel comfortable, safe and taken care of at this hotel. The staff we feel are genuine and just very sweet and sincere. If we need to scale back on expenses, we stay in the other section which is quite nice and clean (very important to us) and save quite a bit too. It's the original section which is modest and nice and still have access to all the facilites and services. We still had the mini-fridge and microwave and high speed and all that fun stuff.

We noticed that there was some disgusting hair all over the walls in the bathroom. It didn't seem the room was cleaned very well at all. In the morning we moved on with our trip not thinking anything more about this bad experience. A week later I noticed some charges on my credit card. When I inquired about them, they were charging me for some sort of chocolate on a lamp shade and dirty sheets. I explained to them that this was not from me and the room wasn't even cleaned when we got there. They refused to remove the charges. Terrible hotel experience.",1,negative

I say thanks to them as it makes a big difference.  The rooms were clean and spacious. The noise level was not bad at all. Things that bothered and even may have changed my mind on staying here is the fact they are under construction and finding a parking spot was almost impossible. Where I was told to park left me worried that my car may get hit by another that night. Second the continental breakfast left alot to be desired. Cold coffee. I think if a property is under going reservations perhaps you should be told that on the phone.,3,negative

I requested a ground floor room as we were on a motorcycle tour to Barrie and surrounding area. They are biker friendly and had a great room around the back out of the way from other cars and trucks. Our BIKES were parked right outside our sliding glass doors. We were able to keep the curtains open and keep an eye on them all night. The pool was clean, although a bit small and a bit shallow but was still able to do short laps. The hot tub was nice after a days RIDE. The ""full breakfast"" was ok. The scramble eggs were a bit tired but the rest was good and of course they had a waffle maker.  Check out staff Arlene was great and split our bill on 2 different credit cards. It is located right off the 400 on the Dunlop East exit. The 1st block. Beer store and restaurants close by. Gas station just up the street.

I have had a doctor check it out, and we had a professional come and insect our home. I was lucky that I kept my bag in the back/box of my truck so I did not bring them into my house. When I called the hotel branch, I was told they would look into it at it would take several hours. I was called back fifteen minutes later and told that there head of house keeping knows what to look for and they could not find anything, and that I should google bed bugs. I am livid! A doctor and a professional exterminator have told me what the bites are but the manager on shift at the hotel is pretty much saying I am in the wrong.

What separates them is the genuine caring they have that my room and my stay is always top notch. This is a business that totally gets the ""art of customer service"" and it makes the stay away from home that much easier. My room is always 100% clean, if I forget a razor or a toothbrush they have that covered too. We bring out of town staff in as well and the comments are identical. Our company will not be staying anywhere else. From the cleaning staff to ownership I thank you very much for such a consistently enjoyable experience.

The location was a bit strange, being near a retail park and just off the highway. First impressions were quite good but our room on the ground floor had a patio door which opened out on to the car park. Just like the other Best Westerns we used on this trip there was a musty smell in the corridors and room and the decor was dated and tired. The bathroom was old-fashioned and not quite clean enough. There were marks on the bedroom carpet and chair. Maybe we were just unlucky with the room as I have read several good reviews of this hotel and in other respects it has everything you need: pool, internet room, fitness centre etc. The rooms have a fridge and microwave but the overall feel is of a motel rather than a hotel. Someone needs to take the Best Western in hand and give it a makeover and a shake-up as it is fast being overtaken by the Hampton Inn and Marriott group.

I've worked for big chains for a number of years (Clarion Resorts, other Best Western's and Blue Mountain) and therefore have a pretty good idea of other properties policies and procedures.   When we checked out on Sunday, I was informed of an extra $150 charge to my room for ""Multiple Noise Complaints"". I was appalled. As far as I know, the registered guest (which was myself) must be informed at least three (3) times of other guests' complaining about noise before this extra fee (or eviction) can occur. I was informed ONCE, by the Night Auditor. We were making a bit of noise because we were attempting to make the room across the hall quiet down. (Our unit immediately shut up after the auditor left).   The girl who checked us out informed me that ""unfortunately [you] will have to pay the fee because only a manager could remove it and being Sunday I have no one in. Even though [you] are right and it shouldn't have been posted in the first place"". I was told BW's manager would be contacting me on Monday December 3rd, 2012. It's now THURSDAY December 6th 2012 and I have not heard from ANYONE. I've called and left messages as well as emailed the property.

Noise: Was issued a noise complaint and 9:30pm the first night there and a threat of eviction on the first and only warning along with at $500 bill if the noise continued - was noise being made? Yes. Was it excessive for 9:30pm? No. The following evening consisted of teenaged girls drinking in the hallway and their obvious arrival home from a night out at 3am as well. The excessive noise after 11pm and children running through the halls at 6am seemed to be no problem, but conversation at 9:30pm was a definite issue. Free Breakfast: Pretty decent.

The lobby is a little dated looking but very clean. The room was also very clean. There was a funny smell when we came in that I thought seemed musty. My husband thought that it was probably the cleaning product used. It seemed to go away after the first time we entered. If it is the cleaning product it might be a good idea for them to give a little squirt of something nicer to offset. Either way we went out about half an hour after we arrived and when we came back it was fine. The room was very clean, the bed was amazingly comfortable and there is a great deep tub in the bathroom. The staff was very helpful. The breakfast is fine, nothing fancy but who expects it to be? Not us.  We chose this location because it was closest to our destination for a gathering that night. We decided to take a cab because we might have a couple of drinks. The hotel called us a cab, the one with all 8's in the phone number. We were going to a location only 5 minutes away per MapQuest and the traffic did not seem bad but it cost us $20 to get there. On the way back we got dropped off by someone who drove and it really did take 5 minutes.  I think the hotel should choose another cab company and let them know why. It was however not their fault. Only other downside is that the only restaurants that are close by are fast food. We were back to the hotel by around 8 and wanted to go for dinner and the only licenced place nearby, in walking distance, was pretty dreary, no other customers and they don't take Visa or have an ATM, which seemed odd.

After a 3 hour drive we arrived to check in and were greeted by a big sign at the front desk saying, ""will be right back"". This was at 4 pm in the afternoon. Five minutes later someone came to the desk, and although pleasant, also informed us that the pool and hot tub were closed because it was a very busy weekend and with all the kids the pool and hot tub were dirty and needed to be cleaned. We took a look at the pool and it was cloudy and greenish. Ewww! We were told, not to worry though it would be open in the morning. I couldn't imagine swimming in that, let alone my family. The front desk agent apologized and did offer us a free bag of instant popcorn. With what seemed to be one of the most surreal customer service recovery tactics, we politely declined the offer of a complementary microwavable snack to make up for the closure of the recreational facilities. We could not even check in.  Luckily, the Horseshoe Resort Area was 15 minutes up the street. 30 minutes later we had checked in to a lovely studio suite with private balcony in the hills across from the indoor pool, hot tub, sauna and games room for less than we were going to pay at this hotel.

Isabelle at the front desk was very helpful over the phone with booking an additional room right next door to our family suite for a last minute addition to our party. We met Isabelle at check-in and she was cheerful and welcoming. She further assisted us in finding a restaurant for dinner. Our room was clean and tastefully decorated. We chose this hotel for the family suite and the pool. We appreciate when everyone in our party of six can sleep in a bed - and the beds were very comfortable - as opposed to a pull-out couch or cot, and that the parents have their own bedroom. However, we would have preferred to have a king bed and an extra bathroom. The one bathroom was tiny and didn't accommodate all of us well. The pool was small but the kids enjoyed it. We weren't concerned about our safety at this hotel until we noticed a security guard pacing the halls and glancing into the pool area. Then, my husband overheard the front desk tell a potential patron that the hotel only accepted credit cards. In the hotel information binder in the room there was a whole page outlining safety tips for guests. When we met our Barrie relatives the next day, they laughed and told us that they referred to the area where we stayed as Barrie's ""red-light district"". We were thankful that we didn't run into any problems and the streets outside were quiet all night. Breakfast was frustrating. We came downstairs to see a line-up out the dining room door and down the hall. Judging by how long the guests ahead of us had been waiting in line, we estimated that it would be about 30 minutes before we got our food and sat down - if there was a table. We decided to eat out and went back to our room to pack up. Once we had loaded the car and checked out, the line-up was short, so we decided to stay. Apart from the many guests who were looking for breakfast, the inefficiency of the buffet was what had caused the long wait. One waffle maker and one toaster slowed everyone down. Having said that, the breakfast was good. The sausages got great reviews.

If we were here longer than the two nights, I would ask for different sheets. The sofa bed is made up with cotton sheets that would be preferable, and if they would fit, I would switch them. I may call down to the front desk, now that I am facing a second night in them.   I wondered down to the lobby seeking coffee at 5:45 and the very friendly and helping front desk person proceeded to set up breakfast and allowed me to take some things back to the room and provided a tray. breakfast does not officially start until 6:30, so this was very much appreciated. The hot items were not yet ready, of course, but the cereal, muffins and cookies were most welcome. Nicely done, Best Western.   I have stayed at several Best Westerns and this one ranks up there.

The laundry dryer took three cycles to dry laundry and the front desk had no change for them anyways and the ATM was often out of service. The rooms and pool area had several areas of water damage and other guests could often be heard complaining about loud ac units ( we were okay with ours although it was a bit on the loud side).

When we got to the hotel, we found out that this was not the case, and the rates for the hotel increased on the weekend, when I had attempted to book online through the hotel's website there had been no increase in price when it was all totalled up. I asked the clerk about this and she shrugged her shoulders saying there was nothing she could do about the discrepancy. When I mentioned on the Sunday morning when we were leaving that we would be complaining to the Best Western head office about this, the clerk changed our room rate to $103.00 / night for the whole weekend which was very nice and accommodating. I'm not sure why the other lady was so rude, but we had several issues with her over the course of the weekend. On the Friday, (July 18th), when we had come back to the hotel in the late afternoon, we were subjected to approximately 45 minutes worth of screams and yells up and down the hallway. When we looked out the door, we found 10 children running back and forth down the hall, and riding on the luggage racks screaming at the top of their lungs. We called front desk and notified the lady (same one) of what was going on, and her response was “They're leaving so they'll be gone soon”. After another 30 minutes of this, one my party went down the hallway and ended up telling off the parents of the children because throughout this entire time, there was absolutely no parental supervision in the hallway. The next day when we were changing rooms, we noticed that we were directly across the hallway from the same families who were making the noise the day before. They noticed too. And the parents, standing outside the doorway, pointed to our door, and then began to scream and shout and have their children scream and shout for 30 minutes. We called the front desk and told them exactly what was going on (again the same lady), and her response was that “They won't be staying at the hotel this evening, their leaving to go to a conference/party/event” and furthermore “Our noise policy doesn't come into effect until 10pm”. After the children left, we had quiet for 10 minutes before the people next door started up and were screaming so loudly that the T.V. and walls were shaking. We were informed that there was a bachelorette party going on next door. We asked to change rooms and were told that because they were fully booked that it was not possible. Then we asked them to talk to the bachelorette party and then again said the noisy policy started at 10pm. So we ended up talking to the bachelorette party, who said they were leaving to go out partying and that they would be gone soon. Just as we went back to our room, we ran into a male stripper headed for the bachelorette party. We were not impressed. They left soon after and then at 2am we were woken up again for half an hour by the bachelorette party returning to their room. We again asked the front desk to intervene. I think really what is most upsetting is that the front desk was so unwilling to help us in any instance, and that the noise policy doesn't come into effect until 10pm. I was really unimpressed by this whole experience and have been completely turned off by the Best Western hotel chain. The only positive in our trip was the complimentary breakfast which was delicious. But the rooms were very small, and so was the pool. The hot tub was very dirty and actually had dead skin cells floating around in it; it was cloudy and unsanitary. Needless to say we will not be staying at this hotel again, and quite honestly, I doubt if we will return to this chain again.",1,negative

Breakfast is a little cramped. The dining area seems to get fairly busy and the kids had to wait in line for quite a while to get to the waffle maker.

I guess that's what happens when there is no ventilation whatsoever.  Would not use this hotel again.",2,negative

I enjoyed my stay there and had to stay a second night unexpectedly but in a different room so I got a good feel overall for the hotel. I liked everything about the hotel except for a few things that I mentioned in the review I left. The bathroom, although very clean, had some mold in the caulking around the tub surround and there were water spots all over the fixtures. Not necessarily the end of the world but for a hotel that looks so clean it kind of shocked me a little. The breakfast is not the best in the continental world for a couple of reasons: 1) the breakfast ""room"" is way way too small and 2) it is a microwave style breakfast other than the usual cereal, toast and yogurt fare. Even the extremely small lobby area was crammed with people eating in the chairs out there. All that being said I would definitely stay there again without hesitation. Barrie has way worse to offer for the same price or more.",5,positive

One room smelled of stale smoke so was undoubtedly a smoking room at some point in the past. Heating in one room sounded like a plane taking off but did provide heat, however the room I stayed in the first night we woke small hours of the morning to find the room frigid. When we asked to move to another room the desk person said there was nothing else in our price range so we said we wanted (desperately) to upgrade, however when we moved to another room later that day; it was only marginally better but the heater was somewhat newer and did work. Room amenities are limited, cups/glasses are paper, no utensils found (to stir coffee etc.). The outside temperatures were frigid at the time (-30C) so I asked the front desk if there were anywhere to plug in my diesel vehicle; they said I would have to ask maintenance. Given it was dark when I arrived I was unable to see any plugs however in daylight there were numerous outlets outside the ground floor rooms all around the periphery of the building. Why didn’t the front desk know this, are they that unobservant?  The self-serve free breakfast was unappealing and geared to get people not to partake. Packaged foods, plastic utensils, cardboard mini plates, watered down juices and limited fruit, breads and cereals are unnecessary. Their resources would be better spent in upgrading the hotel.  My first and last trip to a Best (Worst) Western.

I was so disappointed - first we stayed on the second floor and in the room the floor was weak, when walked by the closet, fridge and desk, the floor shook the furniture. The room is really outdated, the bathroom was terrible, the door didn't close as it was warped and the floor also felt weak. The pillows were awful, with 4 pillows, thought 2 would have been softer. The walls are paper thin, you can hear everything in the hallway and rooms on other side. The fridge was so noisy it kept me up, when I turned off the heat. Due to the late hour we arrived, I was too tired to complain or ask to be moved. In the morning, I told the front desk and they just said Oh, we are going to be upgrading those rooms soon, and thanks for letting us know about the room. I have stayed in poor rooms, but for Ontario this has had to be the worst and I have a hotel card for this chain. Afraid to say, but very poor accommodations all around.

Unfortunately there was a Pee Wee Hockey tournament going on in the city and the hotel was full of young boys and their parents. When we got there the kids were screaming up and down the corridor and the parents were all standing around outside my room drinking and socializing. No problem, really, until the evening when the kids were still hyper and the parents were still gathered outside my room getting louder and louder. I complained to the Front Desk lady twice and she went and spoke with the parents, to no avail. By 10:30pm they were even louder. I called the Front Desk and let it ring 60 times. No answer. I poked my head out my door and asked them nicely to go to someone's room and get out of the corridor. They apologized but carried on until 11pm. Needless to say the noise in the corridor started very early in the morning as the kids had to have breakfast and get to their games. This whole experience was horrible. The room was okay but make sure you find out who else is staying in the hotel as these parents had absolutely NO consideration for anybody else. The hotel has provided them with a hospitality suite but they preferred to stand around in the corridor. The staff person was useless. As for the room, it was moderately clean, a bit worn, the toilet needs a tune-up and the heat/air unit is noisy.

I have to give a shout out to the evening front desk employee, Shannon! She was SO amazing to all of us. The young boys just adored her. Thank You for making my son feel like he wasn't a nuisance! It is appreciated. The housekeeping staff were great too. A couple of things that could be given some attention are....the amount of chlorine in the little pool! I know there were a lot of kids in and out of it, but they were all complaining of the amount of chlorine. The meeting room we rented for the weekend was in the cellar, and although I was warned that it wasn't 'pretty' when I booked it, it also didn't have a working television or any heat? When I asked to upgrade to the other meeting room on the main floor, which would have worked better for us, and it was empty.....I was told by the owner that it was twice as much $150 a night! A little steep for a room with some tables/chairs and a tv! The hot tub also did not work.....maybe because of all the kids??? Overall we were very pleased, and if ever in Barrie for another hockey tournament I will definitely book here again, and also recommend it.

After a shower, there is water all over the floor, the paint was pealing all over the walls and the caulking in the washroom looked like it was done by a 5 year old. The sliding doors were filthy and a little windex would work wonders. Front Desk, no help at all, they claim they were renovating, I even talked to the owner of the property and he had very little idea about customer service. I checked on line and we could have booked the room on that day for $97.00 tax in while we reserved more than a month in advance for $115.00 plus tax. It is not the cleanest Best Western I have been at. Please check out the Best Western in Cornwall, they get it right, clean, clean, clean and customer service all the way.

There were no interior hallways, and the pool was so cold that even during a heat wave it was too hard to stay in for more than a few minutes. Friendly though.  THIS Best Western is totally different. Lovely, beautiful warm pool. Really nice lobby and breakfast area (and breakfast was pretty nicely managed with an attendant there). You have hallways that you need a room card key thing to enter so it feels more secure. Free Wifi, good parking. The rooms were really nice and clean and we all had a balcony. Beds were fine. The housekeeping staff made an effort to make it nice too- they have a cool way to fold the bath mat - hey it's the little things!  The best part was the friendliness of the staff. We rolled in from Northern California at around 9 pm for check in. The nicest people were at the check in. They offered us towels for the pools and fresh coffee (note they OFFERED I did not ask or even think to ask for these things). The morning crew were super nice and every housekeeping person or the maintenance guy we saw all were friendly and said good morning.  The location is good for a traveler: it's near some big box restaurants like Applebee's and some shops. Not that I love Applebee's, but when you are rolling in at 9 pm after a 5 hour drive and want food, it's a welcome site. As much as I love SLO, I did not want to drive to the quaint downtown and look for parking and find a place to eat. In the morning, we had to buy some last minute stuff and the nearby Kohl's and supermarket were a blessing. It's also right by the famous Madonna Inn.  We could not hear any highway sounds in our room. We could not hear our neighbors. We COULD hear people walking down the hall, but no biggie.   But rea

First of all I have to say there is nothing royal about that hotel. The carpet in the room felt humid under my feet and there was a smell of dampness in the room. The washroom was even in worse condition. The walls and ceiling of the shower were mouldy and looked just disgusting.

Let me begin by saying that I asked EXPLICITLY if they were doing renovations and was told no. I also wanted to ensure that the pool was up and running. Again, I was assured that it would be. Imagine my disappointment when we arrived to find the hotel under renovation and the pool closed. Strike One. We had booked a family suite since my son was having surgery the next day. I was told that the suite was one of the newly renovated rooms, so I was excited. Imagine our disgust when my son went to use the washroom to find the toilet ""used"" and unclean. I immediately hailed a maid who tended to it. I then brought it to the attention of the Front Desk. Strike Two. We were going out for supper and turned the A/C on to cool the two rooms down. Upon our return, we noticed that the one air conditioner was not working and the room was unbearably hot. Apparently, there is no one to look after maintenance after 5 pm. Strike Three. Now, the topper is what I found over my bed on the headboard. It was a ""leftover"" from the couple who had stayed in the room before...two clear handprints side by side right above the pillow, along with other gross reminders. I immediately marched down to the front desk to speak to them about this. When the front desk clerk came up to see and sanitize the area, she too was disgusted. I was told that my bill would be adjusted for my grief and stress. The next morning, upon checkout, I spoke to the Manager on Duty about my issues. I am not thoroughly satisfied with the response I received about the ""cleanliness"" of the room: ""I can assure you that it is not what you think."" When I asked if anyone else, namely a man and woman, had used the room prior, I was told yes, but she said, ""I can guarantee you it was not from them."" Really? Unless there are cameras in the room, that is quite a stretch to say. On a side note, I was refunded $50 for my grief for a $150 night stay. Best Western Royal Oak...questionable at best.",1,negative

Clearly, my room was not one of the ""renovated"" rooms as it was dark / dingy / musty / mold smelling room. I understand that new construction is occurring but it doesn't excuse the bathroom not being cleaned properly (hair stuck to the walls) paint peeling off the walls and no shelves being available in the bathroom for towels. There was a tiny little ledge where all the towels were put that was directly above the toilet bowl. With two kids it's not too hard to figure out what happened. Decorative bed covers were gross and looked and smelled like they hadn't been washed ever. The mattresses were absolutely horrible- felt extremely flat and over used - and none of this has to do with renovations. The air conditioner unit has no temperature controls other than numbers so not sure how to regulate the temp of a room so it's comfortable? The carpet smelled absolutely revolting: musty / moldy and should have been replaced 5 years ago. Last, beware room 115 looks out directly at a brick wall. So to summarize - yes construction is happening but does not excuse poor quality or state of the current rooms that, to me, represents poor management and at least several years of not caring, neglect, or poor up keeping of the facility. I will say that hotel staff that I did see during my staff were genuine and caring individuals but the issues were way above their ability to deal with.

The bathroom door was cracked at the striker (near handle), the door on the ""closet cabinet"" could not be opened given that the inside of the door was broken at the hinge area. The curtain liner was also torn and as a result, sunlight would come into the room in the morning. Very poor sound insulation. If the incoming light didn't wake us, other guests walking the hallway would have. Hot tub was empty and did not work and the pool is small and needs cleaning.  On a positive note, we really enjoyed the morning breakfast.   Despite the good breakfast, we will not be staying there again.

We were commuting to Borden each morning, so the location of the hotel was great as we just had the one road to drive down. No fear of getting lost! There are quite a few restaurants nearby as well, so no need to drive around for suppers; we could walk there.  The front desk staff were very helpful and although the hotel was undergoing renovations, we weren't inconvenienced at all. During our stay the hot tub was not available but the pool and the workout room were. The free breakfast in the morning was quite nice and it never got crowded when we were there from 6:15 to 7 AM or so. It is suppose to only open at 6:30 so it was a nice surprise that we could go in early. Not a lot of choice but the scrambled eggs were fresh and hot and always a choice of sausage or bacon. Toast, bagels, cereal, cookies, muffins, yogurt, apples, bananas, etc. always available too. The rooms were large, and internet was great. I watched Netflix every night and could connect my computer to the TV because I brought an HDMI cable.   The only small glitch was that the cleaning staff were inconsistent. The tub was not cleaned well when I checked in. Not extremely dirty, but you could tell it was not well cleaned from when the last guest was there. The next day, however, it was well cleaned. Midway through the week I accidentally spilled a bit of coffee on the white counterpane on the bed. The next couple of days the chambermaid still made the bed and kept the stained counterpane on the bed. Because I knew where the stain came from I didn't report it, but all the same, I felt it should have been changed without my having to ask. It was obvious the stain was there and couldn't really be missed. Although the cleaning was a small, small part of my stay, I feel it is the most important part that may deter me from coming back.

The free internet access worked for a few minutes then stopped; I'm sure this would have been very annoying to someone who really needed to be on line. The adjustable chair at the desk would not adjust high enough for me to reach the keyboard of my computer comfortably. The bedspread appeared to be well used and all the lightness and fluffiness must have been laundered out of it long ago; it provided weight rather than warmth which does not lead to a good night's sleep..

One bed was OK but not great and the other was a pull-out sofa bed that was not too good - I've slept in pullouts that don't feel like a pull-out and this wasn't that good.. I don't know why they don't just have two queen beds instead of a queen and a pull-out. The room was clean, the mini fridge and microwave and TV all worked.  We were on the 4th floor.  My main complaint with the hotel is that we were woken at 5:30 by a rhythmic pounding. I couldn't tell where it was coming from, I thought it must be a drummer or construction machinery. When it didn't stop I phoned the front desk and asked ""do you hear that noise?"" and the response was ""you can hear it in your room?"". Since the front desk staff could hear it I asked if they could investigate and stop it. I couldn't get back to sleep so I went looking for the noise - it seemed to be coming from everywhere but was louder in the stairwell. I tracked it down to the first floor exercise room - it was someone running on the treadmill. This can't be the first time this has happened, the staff must have known about it - why the hotel has a treadmill that can wake people up 3 flights above is a mystery, and why they let people use it at 5:30 is another mystery.  So the staff had my complaint - I had phoned them at 5:30, how often does that happen? But they never followed up, no explanation from them, no apology, nothing.  Later in the day we found out that pretty much everyone with our hockey team was woken by the sound, so it wasn't just us.  I was also a little annoyed that the hotel booked hockey teams for tournaments but was unwilling or unable to make meeting rooms or party rooms available in the evening for socializing. I've been in many hotels where they are happy to do this at no cost (it keeps the kids out of the halls and with their parents) but the BW would only allow the use of a pretty miserable room in the basement for a fee, and then only for one night. The second night, no room was available for us.  I know that making spaces available for socializing wasn't part of the room rental contract, but it's a pretty common practice and would make me select a different brand in the future. For the same price (actually a few dollars cheaper), 2 weeks earlier I was at a different hotel 50km away that had nicer rooms, better beds, a much better breakfast, and gave us access to a party room in the evenings.

Check-in and check-out was helpful, fast and organized. The room was quiet, clean, the WiFi (internet) connection was quick, the decor of the room was nice and the bed was comfortable. In addition, the outside grounds was clean and easy to park especially with the snow that came down.  The breakfast had plenty of bacon/sausage, bagels, waffles and yogurt with coffee and juices which was fresh and fine but some suggestions I have are: an improved menu with some fruit and the breakfast room needed some updated tables, chairs and decor. The hotel proximity to Highway 400 is convenient and not to far of a drive (under 10 minutes) to Ski Snow Valley in Barrie.  Lastly, the customer service I received was excellent from front desk, housekeeping and the service at breakfast. I would stay at this hotel again.

When I arrived in my room, there was hair on the pillow that was obviously not mine since I had not even sat on the bed yet. The walls were full of marks and stains that should have been wiped off. The floors squeak loudly when walked on. When inside the room, you can hear every foot step above you, ever conversation in the rooms next to you and in the halls. If you are looking for quiet to sleep, this is not the hotel for you. The TV continuously cuts out and looses signal. It happened every single day of my extended stay. As for the fitness center...it is small with only three pieces of equipment, two of which do not work. There is an ATM, but do not count on getting money out of it as it has been out of service for some time. Oh...and hopefully you do not get up early and require assistance from the front desk because no one answers the phone.

The addition is now complete. Looks like just a few loose ends (tiling and updating hallways) were to be finished, and were being finished when I stayed. The 'tower' as the staff called it, (the new addition) is wonderfully decorated. We asked to see one of the tower rooms and one of the traditional rooms. Same price for a opening rate. We chose to stay in the traditional room as the agent called it because we wanted the ground floor access. Both sections were decorated wonderfully and not old or drab at all. I guess they call the older side traditional, because it looks like you average hotel room that has not been modernized, but they have all the things we were looking for in it. (Fridge, microwave etc) The continental breakfast lady was wonderful and very happy for so early in the morning! Pool was a good temperature and no over kill on the chlorine. The tower rooms were very modernly decorated. Very nice. The Windows didn't open though. The patio door access that we choose was very nice to have, made unloading and loading very easy. Front desk staff always willing to provide great service. The gentleman at night (older male) wasn't so much, but maybe thats why he is on midnights? He told us someone would take care of our requests in the morning since he was busy with paper work and we did say we didn't need the item right that minute. Rooms were clean and looked well kept for the most part. I will be staying here again when we come to Barrie. Very good rates in compitition with other hotels on the same street.",4,positive

Didn't really like the fact there were some people walking past the windows in the room so had to keep the curtains pulled for privacy. The main floor hallway seemed a little busy, people walking past with equipment and so on. Could also hear the person in the room above walking around (a lot). I should have asked for a room on an upper level. My fault. I have stayed in a number of other BW's, I would say this one seemed just a bit off overall (could have seemed a bit cleaner as a whole), but it was OK.

The service was excellent upon check in and the staff was most helpful when answering my questions about nearby amenities. The rooms are tidy, the beds are comfortable and the breakfast is great. The pool was small and full of children, but that's to be expected during the March break. This also explains why the floor of the shower near the pool had candy on it. The fitness area is in need of new flooring as the carpet is dated. This hotel is currently undergoing renovations which I noticed upon arrival.

Well worth the extra money with 2 teenagers. Two queen beds in separate room and one queen in main room along with kitchenette (fridge, hot plate, counter, sink, dishes etc), small table, 4 chairs and a bench. Room was clean, modern decor, with comfortable beds and nice bedding. Handy to have a kitchenette and small fridge/freezer (bigger than a mini fridge). Pool is very small and I dipped my toe in (nice and warm) but didnt swim as there were tons of little kids in and out of the pool (personal issue). Hotel charges 175 for meeting room which is very small with long tables, chairs and a tv. Hockey parents who like to ""congregate"" would not find this a great option. I would think booking an extra team suite for parents at a cheaper rate and adding it to the team cost of the tourney would have made sense.

The mattresses and pillows were very comfortable. There was a mini fridge and microwave in the room.  Parking and WIFI were free, and the room rate included breakfasts for the 3 of us. Other motels we were considering booking only included breakfasts for 2 people per room. The breakfasts were good. They continued to put fresh eggs, sausages and pastries out until 10 AM.  The bathroom looked like it had been recently renovated. It was modern and spacious and had good lighting. Every employee we met smiled and wished us a pleasant stay. They were all friendly and very helpful. The location was ideal, close to both Hwy 400 and downtown Barrie. Our only negative was the thinness of the walls between rooms. We could hear the guests in the adjacent rooms. However, the noise died down by 10 PM so it did not affect the quality of our sleep.

We were in the hotel parking lot within 2 mins. of exiting the highway. This hotel has just completed extensive renovations and looks new from top to bottom. The check-in at the reception desk was efficient and courteous and we were in a spotless and spacious king bedroom in the all new tower section of the hotel within 5 mins. The room had a desk with internet access, an extremely comfortable king bed with plenty of pillows and a seating area with a pull out sofa. In addition there was a microwave, bar fridge and a large LCD screen that could swivel towards the bed or seating area. The bathroom was well lit and ventilated with a two speed fan which is great to avoid the ever unpopular post shower bathroom fog up which in most hotels makes the mirror unusable for 10-15mins. The pool area looked very nice however we were not there long enough to use. The fitness area looked well equipped also. We came back from the concert quite late and the parking lot was very well lit and felt very safe. I know this seems like endless praise and perhaps that is explained by the virtue of it being essentially a new hotel, but they did things right..  My only suggestion is that they improve the breakfast offering . To compete with similar priced hotels they need to expand the selection beyond the major ""carb"" offering. It was though, exactly as they advertised.   My first stay at a Best Western hotel and a completely satisfying one! I dont hesitate to recomend it highly!",5,positive

We could hear everything our neighbors were saying.. and by everything I mean everything! Even calling the front desk to complain did little to rectify the situation.. the neighbors turning the music off only helped clarify the sound of their conversations. I eventually discovered the majority of the sound came through the paper thin door that connects adjoining rooms.. these doors need some serious upgrades with better sound proofing technology. Fixing this problem should be the #1 priority in their 2017 strategic plan.

But the male attendant at that time wasn't able to confirm our late check out-- though he was the one who checked us in and took our prepaid late check out.--  The following attendant was no further help, but still polite; referring us to the manager whom started her shift at 8am on Saturday September 24th 2016.

The only drawback is rugs that need to be replaced. The beds were of fine sleeping quality, cleanliness,flawless, and the bathroom facilities just fine.

The staff kept things replenished, and were friendly and helpful in other ways as well.

I was looking forward to a romantic weekend with my new Husband.. I booked a King Bedroom suite with jacuzzi tub... #1. They failed to tell me that my room was ona smoking floor. My husband does not smoke.. #2. Got to the floor and the it just reaked of cigarette smoke and the smell of POT just was horrific. I sooo wanted to gag. and the smell gave me and instant headache.. #3 I complained to the hotel staff about the smell of pot. They apologized to me. Brought up a fan to the floor hoping it would get rid of the smell.... #4 My husband finally arrived about half hour after me.. He was not happy at all with the smell or the fact that we where on a smokers floor. But the hotel told me that was the only floor that had that kind of suite. Not really what you want after driving 6 hours to get there.  The room was nice though I must say. I was very impressed with it. and so was my husband. The morning breakfast was very good too. Had a choice of hot and cold to eat and drink. I did get massive heartburn on the sat night. I asked the staff if they had some rolaids or tums. Unfortunantly they did not carry or sell them. Just a suggestion... Maybe they should. Overall.. I would have to say. The room was nice.. The Floor that its on is NOT.. Would I stay there again?? Probably not. Especially for a $150 per night to breath in smoke and pot fumes.,3,negative

He is the face of the hotel and acted like it was a boring place to work and stay. The room was clean and spacious and the bed is comfy. As I was getting into bed, I noticed a huge piece of gum on the side table!! EW! I called the desk and housekeeping removed it the next day. Breakfast was okay but its in a tight corner so its crammed when there are only 3 people. I expected more from reading the previous reviews.",2,negative

Well, not this hotel. They went out of their way to lower their price to $89 per room plus tax and they gave us the use of the Georgian room common area and fridge for our team's socializing. The front desk staff was very patient with all of our random requests and when reminded that 50 people plus their other guests would all be wanting breakfast between 7 and 8 am they assured us the food would be plentiful and that it wouldn't run out. They were true to their word. They maintained a lovely warm buffet breakfast and provided trays if we wished to take it to our rooms (as the eating area was small). Even though this hotel doesn't have a pool (which would have been nice) it had all the comforts we required. In the area there is a great little restaurant called Sticky Fingers that some of our ball parents visited, the zehrs is just up the road and there is a baseball diamond for a practice just a couple blocks away.  Rooms are as expected, standard and clean. The suite room 115 was great for having a quick team meeting before sending them over to the Georgian room for dinner. I would bring a team here again and I will recommend it to the other travel teams in our league as well!",4,positive

I had reserved four rooms at the time of booking, six months in advance of our stay, and had requested rooms with refrigerators. On check-in I was advised that there were no refrigerators in our rooms as they had been moved to the rooms that had workers staying there for long term stays. Of the two ice machines one was broken and the other one was usually empty. The back door exits, although they had disposal bins for cigarette butts, were littered with butts all over the ground. When this was pointed out to the management there was no effort to even clean this up. One of our party's room was not serviced on the day that they were away. They front lobby and a staircase to the lobby was littered with cereal that had been taken from the lobby. Although the staff was friendly there were no offers of compensation for any of our inconveniences. This Comfort Inn is certainly not upholding the high standard that this chain usually offers.

One person was sick the morning we were leaving. There was no table and chairs in our suite & when I went down to inquire as why there wasn't any the young fella at the desk looked up something on the computer & after about 5 mins informed me that there wasn't any for this particluar suite. I asked then what if the 5th person had come where was he to sit as the only other seat was the computer chair other than a 3 seater couch?? I asked if we could at least have another chair such as a sofa chair but he said he would check but couldn't guarantee it. Never did get one. The air conditioner in the bedroom wasn't the greatest either. Also on Saturday as we were getting ready to leave for a wedding the cleaning girl came and we told her we would be leaving in few minutes, when we returned all she had done was change the towels she didn't even clean the bathroom as the sink still had hair & toothpaste in it.The morning we were leaving there wasn't even any place to sit for breakfast & with no table in our room we checked out and went to a restaurant for breakfast even though it came with the reservation.Needless to say we never left a tip.

A few colleagues and I had booked two rooms as we were participating in a curling tournament that weekend. I had reserved both rooms under my name and credit card and made the reservations over the phone as we were able to get a discount because of the tournament.   Upon arrival the man at the front counter told us that only one of our rooms was ready as the second one was still being cleaned, therefore we grabbed the keys and unloaded all of our luggage in the one available room and headed over to the rink for the day. At about 10:30pm we returned and attempt to check in to our second room as we told the front desk we would. The lady proceeded to tell me that our reservation only showed the one room, that we did not book two rooms and that the hotel was full for the night and they could not offer us a room. After approximately 10 minutes of me asking this lady how 12 hours ago I had two rooms reserved and now only have one, she continued to tell me that she couldn't do anything and that her manager would be in at 7am and I could speak to the manager regarding the situation.   ...... It is 10:45pm by now and the lady at the front desk told me that I could speak to the manager at 7am... SERIOUSLY?! The lady continued to be not help at all, she didn't even offer to call other hotels to see if they had any rooms or ANYTHING! The other female colleague I was with decided to let our two males colleagues have the one room and her and I walked up the road (at minus 20 degrees) to the Holiday Inn. The holiday was a bit more expensive however I have never been so thankfully for a hotel!  This experience really made me question this hotel... how do you just give away someones room. And say it does happen, technology and all... how is it okay to be completely useless and not even offer us a phone book to call another hotel in the city OR tell use we can speak to her manager in 8+ hours.

There were 6 adults in our group. We stayed in room #201 which has 2 queen beds in a bedroom and a sofa bed in the living room. The beds were comfortable and appeared to be clean. I cannot say the same for the sofa or for the carpets. The cushions on the sofa and chair and the carpets had disgusting stains on them. We didn’t even want to sit on the sofa let alone sleep on it. The bedding on the sofa bed looked like it had been used before because the sheets were crumpled under the one thin blanket. We had to call the front desk for extra pillows for the sofa and extra towels even though I indicated there would be 6 adults in the room when I booked it. When checking in we paid for 6 adults. I suspect the room was not prepared for 6 adults and that the sofa bed had not been changed after the last person used it. There is a shabby runner that kept getting caught in the door.  We were very disappointed in the condition of the room. I have always had good luck with other Choice Hotels but will certainly not recommend this location to anyone and will think twice before booking another Choice Hotel in the future.

We chose Comfort Inn based on the chain's positive reputation. Sadly this hotel did not measure up.  Upon checking in, the front desk was advised that occupants in our room have mobility challenges & we were given a 1st floor room as the hotel does not have elevators. Having recently incurred an injury that limited my mobility & causing extreme pain the one thing I was looking forward to was a bath. Unfortunately I soon found that the stopper in the tub was ineffective.  I contacted the front desk to ask for support. I was asked ""can't you just put a face cloth in the drain?"" I explained that this would not hold water and was told that a stopper would be sent from another room.  A short time later I received a phone call from the front desk asking if I had used the stopper correctly. I noted that I thought I had. She then indicated that housekeeping & maintenance were not on site (8pm) & there was nothing that could be done. When I voiced my inability to stand in a shower, she indicated that I could sit in the tub with the water running.   No one ever came to the room or offered an alternate solution making my bathing routine even more challenging & causing additional pain.   After I completed my hygiene, I eagerly reached my bed. It was there that I found that the room was not as clean as it appeared during check in. Once the bedding was drawn back I found make up on the duvet. The air conditioner also had a great deal of dust hanging from it.  Dirty & no accommodations for persons with mobility challenges this hotel fails to meet basic expectations",2,negative

I do not recommend staying here if you value cleanliness and customer service.  When we first arrived it was clear that the motel had been getting regular calls asking for last minute reservation. The staff's demeanor and tone suggested she was getting tired of telling people that everything was booked and that to her knowledge most other motels were as well. Aside from that, the check-in went smooth.   We had reserved the family suite, which was nicely decorated. However all the furniture except the beds were 1 to 2 feet away from the wall. The mini fridge was missing all of the door shelving. When we got the washroom ready for the children's bath time I noticed that there were hairs everywhere: the previous occupants had shaved and housekeeping must have used the same rag to wipe the shower down. The shower curtain also had not been changed and those same hairs were lining the wall behind the toilet. Most disgusting of all, when I wiped down the counter top it came back with a layer of dust and dirt. With this we decided to check the beds sheets – we found body hair in both beds. I'm not sure if it was left overs from being washed or if the sheets were not changed.   When we called reception (it was around 10 PM) and asked for disinfectant wipes and new bedding for the two beds, the male receptionist did not ask the reason why and sent his co-worker. It took her four trips (first trip: one set of sheets, second trip; the second set of sheet and two blankets, third trip; two pillow cases). I asked why she would have brought only two pillow cases given that we needed at the minimum three. My spouse then asked that she just grab a whole pile of pillow cases instead of just grabbing the one that was required for the night. Her reply was completely unprofessional; with the attitude of a catty teenager she replied that she 'could not beleive this', and that 'she' was doing 'us' a favor. We ended up making our own beds as the service was never offered and we did not want to deal with the staff's attitude. I called the front desk once again and spoke to the male receptionist and stated that we were canceling our week long reservation; once again no questions were asked.   Upon check out, the male receptionist from the previous night was the person to serve us. When he asked how our stay was I asked him if he recalled talking to me the previous night. I was surprised to hear that he did remember. I proceeded to vent my frustration and disgust – meanwhile he had an empathetic look and had his smile on. To this date I still wonder how people in the motel industry, especially a motel chain, can be so incompetent. To the motel's credit, his co-worker chimed in and explained that the manager had been given the details of our stay and had provided a discounted price on the room.",1,negative

We had to stay here as all other local hotels were booked for the weekend, and to be honest, if I had known this was going to be my experience I'd have slept in my car.   Each night at around 1am the halls would fill with people drinking, yelling, slamming doors, laughing, banging on doors, whistling, and all sorts of other fun stuff that makes it hard to sleep.   Calls to the front desk and attempts to talk to the drunken revelers in the halls did nothing. Things finally quieted down around 4am each night.   So, if you are looking for a place to party and stay up all night, then this is your place. But, if you feel that a hotel is a place to get a good night's rest, then run, run far away from this place.

We chose Comfort Inn because we had great experiences at the other locations and wanted to give it a chance... Walking into the front desk was very different from any other location. The staff seemed confused and frustrated with the amount of people checking in (I guess more business is a bad thing?!?!) We all ran up to our rooms and quickly left for the festivities, not giving us a chance to look over the room before we left. when we came back, we began to look around the room and make ourselves comfortable, when to our surprise a USED condom was beside the bed!!!! Absolutely disgusted I took a picture for proof and called the front desk. They informed me that no one would come up for about a half hour to fix the problem (in other words 11pm) I'm sorry but I would consider this a pretty big deal and something that should be fixed right away, even if it means moving rooms... At that point we just went to bed, asking them not to even bother coming up. The next morning everyone's bills where wrong! Thank goodness we're all family and were going to the same place so we could sort it out ourselves! I spoke with the manager about these issues and to be honest, it seemed like she didn't really care... she made excuses, offered a coupon for my return (YA RIGHT!) and told me I could email her the photo, however hung up before I was given her email. Overall I find it hard to be away from home, and even though I was seeing my family, I want to feel at home in a hotel, not like a burden. Someone needs to get in there ASAP and turn it around like the other locations. Im surprised anyone's ever had a good visit here.

Room was a good size, vanity area, full bathroom, closet w/iron/board, 2 double beds, TV, dresser, desk w/chair and another chair. Table in between beds had telephone and clock radio. Left hotel at 5 for concert and came back after midnight. Very quiet for a long weekend. We both slept very well, had their OK continental breakfast in morning and checked out at noon. There is a Tim Horton's and Wendy's next door, so we went to TH's and had a coffee and bagel before heading home.

I thought our room was nice and was very clean, bed was comfortable, bathroom was also clean and renovated. My only issue is that I was overcharged for the room. I was charged the correct booking amount for the room on the day I checked out, but was also charged an additional fee of US $292 seemingly charged on the day I checked in. I've contacted the hotel manager and they say they only have a record of the original room rate charge (which is what I have a receipt for). I do not believe this place has a computer system, when we checked in, our reservation was on a slip of paper, when we checked out, I had to physically swipe my card to pay. I also had to swipe my card when I checked in for a pre-authorziation charge in for incidentals and such, which is how I think this error happened. I'm still in the process of working with the hotel to get a refund, while they've been responsive, no one can tell me why I was charged and no one can find evidence of the charge, although I've supplied them with my credit card statements. They are claiming they need to review the log of their credit card history, however, it's been very inconvenient.

Thought it was corrected to best of our knowledge, but only because my friend called me and I called hotel.   - at checkin, 1) no lobby after being told hotel has been completely renovated not right in the middle of a renovation. 2) did not get room I booked ( 2 queens and a pullout) Only a king and pullout. Front desk said no room like that was available as it was being used for storage. Found us a cot we had to carry down stairs, told that extra pillows were not available and we had to have 1 person sleep on floor.  - breakfast first morning... Found moldy sausage in high chair, no where to sit, no spoons for cereal, no plates, empty cereal containers, and waffles that just stuck in maker. The staff member was working front desk and breakfast which is a complete management issue, taking a shortcut on staffing.   - talked again with front desk staff and nothing was done about issues just an ""I'm sorry"" and reconfirmed that one of the rooms with 2 queen /pullout configuration was indeed storage and the other had water damage.  - checked out early to go elsewhere for breakfast on 2nd day  - for a renovated hotel many item in the room had pieces missing and looked original but with new paint and the toilet seat was barely attached.

193897333,barrie/ca/154980/182804/193897333.html,Quality Inn,"A ""Choice Club"" Member for many years, my wife and I have stayed at their locations across North America (and Europe). This particular Quality Inn was just converted from a Travelodge. Although renovations are said to be complete, there remains a lot of upgrading to do to achieve the standards most Choice Club Members would expect. Our ground floor room had a direct outdoor entrance (including a sliding screen door) - great potential. However, with no indoor sliding door to protect against the outside cold (or heat in the summer) it left a significant draft when the only sliding door was closed. A replacement door and casing is certainly in order for Room 117. The TV worked flawlessly. Furnishings were quite good. The desk chair may suite some - but I almost flipped over backwards as it goes way back before providing any support. This was also the case with the desk chair at the computer in the lobby. Strange? The heater in Room 117 was inconsistent - either blowing cold air, or barely warm. The hotel quickly offered us a very effective space heater with specific temperature setting controls. This was very much appreciated and was more then sufficient to get us comfortably through the very cold night outside (-23C). When we left, our room heater had decided to work and was belting out the heat. We reported the issue to the Front Desk and hope that it will be resolved. The bathroom in our room was clean and well equipped - but we had to use the heater to warm up the room sufficiently to be able to take a bath and shower. The breakfast room was adequate in size, and had good hot and cold options from which to choose. However, being directly in front of the entranceway to the motel, the room temperature quickly dropped from adequate to bone chilling cold when anyone entered or left the building. Reason: the inside door was broken, and had obviously been for some time (no attempt to ensure that drafts were deflected from the breakfast area - pity the check in staff who worked there on cold days/evenings). DANGEROUS ENTRANCE: The ceramic tiles in the lobby and swimming pool areas are deadly slippery. This is not acceptable and could result in very serious accidents. It is not fair to judge a motel by one stay. We will, therefore, return in May or June when passing through the area again. Hopefully any deficiencies noted this time will be fixed. There is much potential for this location - but additional renovations are certainly needed.

194335593,barrie/ca/154980/182804/194335593.html,Quality Inn,"Spent 4 nights at this hotel, first impressions were that it was a great location which I got for a great price direct from their website. While checking in I needed the addition of an additional nights stay which wasn't a problem at all, very accommodating. We were placed on a second floor room which was a smaller size, but for 2 people was fine. The friday and saturday nights were sold out with what appeared to be a hockey tournament. The hotel became busy and loud at this time but what else is to be expected in the winter on a weekend. The first 2 mornings we attempted to have the hot breakfast (between 8:30-9) and decided against it because of the massive line and lack of seating. There were only a few things that really urged me. The first being the lack of handicapped parking. For having a sold out hotel, and a few feet of snow, having one handicapped parking spot became a free-for-all. We had to ask one person to move their truck because they didn't have a sticker but ""needed to plug their truck in"". The second is the flooring in the lobby. Unless your shoes/boots are 100% dry, you WILL fall. I slipped once and gave myself a nice bruise on the knee from it. It is SO dangerous, so please stay on the mats. The last thing was an incident involving the wifi. My husband and myself both have laptops, phones and tabs which we were using with the wifi. On our third evening both our laptops would not connect to the internet. We tried with all our other electronics with no success. I had called down to the front desk to see if it was working down there. I was greeted with "" Yes, its working down here, its working fine."" Being technologically inclined, I knew all that needed to be done was to reset the router. I was told "" well you have to be on the network with the strongest signal"" ….obviously. Being spoken to like I was the person in the wrong is pretty sad when what your request is simply ""guest service"". I even went down to see if there was a wired connection to use (which there is not) The attitude I got was pretty horrible and being someone who has worked in the hospitality industry is negligent. Besides these incidents the hotel is good for the price.

I think that they did a pretty good job, doing so. The lobby was complely renovated, and is now a spacious,airy,aand bright area where you are greeted by the friendly front desk staff.Next to the lobby is the new breakfast area, where the focal point is the ceiling high stone fireplace, with a gas insert, and of course, all new tables, and chairs Behind the fireplace, is a little nook, where there is a small business area,and some easy chairs, where you can relax, and enjoy a cup of coffee, with the morning paper. All the corridors, and rooms have new carpeting, and the new pool area has a whirlpool bath, and the one wall is allglass,giving plenty of light into the room. My room had new beds, and bedding,and all the furniture, fixtures, drapery, and wall hangings were all brand new .Breakfast offered the bulk of the food in a separate room ,off the main eating area. The food offerings were scrambled eggs, and sausages,cereals, breads and rolls ,yogurt,wafflesd, and plenty of fresh, hot coffee.I understand that the final phase oif renovation, is to do some exterior work,which nwill include replacing the sliding doors in the ground floor rooms.

When I did head out I removed it and out it on the closet shelf. However after a long day I returned to an uncleared room dirty sheets and no towels. When I went to complain I was told my do not disturb sign was up. Yes it was in the morning but before ten o'clock it was removed so I wasn't pleased. I requested a clean room for the next day and my sheets changed. The next day my sheets were still unchanged but my room was cleaned. However the room key had to be reprogrammed every day which was a problem going to room with hands full and running back down to desk. I was told sometimes that happens. The following day sheets finally changed, but headed to bed in my pjs we noticed our tv converter was missing spent half hour searching it never showed up had to go to front desk to replace it guess that's what happens when you complain the maid gets even. Or so I suggested to front desk but they said they wouldn't do that. The one good thing about this room is the new beds which are like sleeping on a cloud very comfortable.

We got there about half hour before check in and our room wasn't ready yet, so we left to do a few errands, the lady we dealt with was very nice and helpful about where things were. We came back about 15 mins after check in time and were told our room still wasn't ready, and likely wouldn't be for at least a half hour, the lady we dealt with then was very abrupt and unapologetic, I asked if we could have any compensation or upgrades but was told since we booked through Expedia that we got nothing. We were so tired from driving and just wanted to freshen up and change before we left for Borden, we weren't even allowed to put our stuff in the room. I used the lobby washroom and witness about 5 housekeeping staff and laundry staff standing in front of the laundry talking?? they are sold out and behind schedule and that's how the staff works?? I feel like the staff doesn't get treated well there so they don't work very hard. The lobby was full of people waiting for their rooms! We had to leave to pick up our son, so we came back to our room finally ready, no apologies, no manager talked to us, nothing! We got into our room and found dirty dishes on top of the microwave. The room was ok, comfy beds and nice linen is about the only positive. The pool was very small looking and dated, we never used it. The air conditioner worked well but very old and missing knobs. The bathrooms were a little grungy looking.  We went for breakfast in the morning but there was no room to sit, as there is not many tables and the breakfast was set up in a tiny little room and you couldn't get to anything. We grabbed a coffee and a bagel and took it back to our room, as that's all we could manage, couldn't even get near the toaster! Also we had to get our room keys reprogramed as they didn't work that day. When we checked out we had to wait forever, to get our room ""inspected"" for damage, first time I ever experienced that??

We found mouldy food in one of the dresser drawers and there was a layer of dust on the coffee maker and all the surfaces. The inside of the microwave clearly hadn't been wiped down in a while. The patio door was very difficult to open due to wood rot and dirt in the tracks. The shower walls were also grimy. We asked for a different room and was originally told no. I think our 3rd trip to the front to complain let them know we truly weren't happy and weren't going to go away. When they finally decided to look at giving us another room, the front desk staff checked 2 additional rooms which they didn't offer us (which makes me wonder what they found). We were shown another room and it was much cleaner. However when we were leaving and I was doing my checking to see if we left anything behind I did find a sock that did not belong to anyone in my family. The beds were comfy and the staff was friendly but I was certainly not happy with the level of cleanliness of the rooms.
 
 
 Room Tip:  Rooms on the first floor in the 100's is where we had problems. Also staff sit outside the door...

As we were there with all friends we received some opinions and some popular activities so it would save us time on our agenda. Some of us arrived a bit before check in so we wanted to head up and just relax. The rooms were ready for us and we did not have to wait. The rooms are nice and clean with a home like comfortable feeling. Theres a swimming pool and it was a nice place to relax and have a dip. Tge hotel is located close to other facilities so we didn't need to drive far to get supplies or grab a bite to eat. The breakfast in the morning is pleasant and peaceful. Overall it was a perfect weekend getaway.  Would highly recommend it everyone..and will definitely be going back myself.,5,positive

When asked if we could have another room I was told they were completely full. I stated everyone checking in could not have check in by now and that would give them time to air out the room (which ended up being strong perfume from the previous customers) I understand that is not their fault however the attitude I received by requesting an alternate room was highly unprofessional. We did end up getting a new room, and as I always do I check the sheets before I crawl into bed. There was a huge mud stain right in the middle of the fitted sheet. First of all, who makes a bed and leaves a sheet like that...poor housekeeping. When I complained to the front desk they brought me a new fitted sheet and left ME TO MAKE THE BED MYSELF. I brought the sheet to the front desk to show them the stain and was received with a oh ya. Would not, will not, stay here ever again.!",1,negative
224168951,barrie/ca/154980/182804/224168951.html,Quality Inn,"The hotel was ok, but were re modelling some of the rooms so can be a little noisy. The hotel is located near the highway so you get a lot of people that are just stopping by and don't really care about what kind on noise they make. We had a work crew partying underneath us who kept partying to the wee hours of the night even after we called the front desk. The dudes were huge so I think they intimidated the staff so we just had to leave our tv on through out the night to help drown out the drunken yelling and banging. The free breakfast they advertise is ok but the eating area is really small and it was full of drunken/ high road people. Its ok if u just grabbing something to go but don't stay and eat in. Our biggest problem was the stinky pool. When we were in it I smelt garbage and wondered where the smell was coming from. If you look at the sides of the pool and smell the liner you will get the answer. PU!!!! The pool liner is just covered in filth. The smell was so bad that we had to take several showers to wash away the smell. I have no idea why they don't clean it but it stank really bad and you don't smell it until your in it. So I would not recommend this hotel if you have a family or like clean pools.",2,negative

There was no elevator pointed out to us, so I had to walk the stairs while still recovering from my broken foot (I didn't have to come and go often, so I just sucked it up). The pool looked clean and relaxing and the complimentary breakfast nook was surprising! I expected some cereal dispensers, bread and a toaster, but I was able to make my own waffles, have some tasty juice, and when I was in a hurry to leave, they didn't look twice at me walking up to my room with my toast in my mouth. The important parts of the room were clean, and the television was great! It would have been nice if the fridge was on when we got there, as it was warm, and had a strange smell. The bathroom was cleaned, but there was a wall beside one of our beds which was covered in what looked like grease or residue from smoking, even though they had told us not to smoke in the room. We opted for the bed by the window, which was fine since it was the two of us. They even accommodated us with our strange requests regarding checkout, and seemed to know the area well when we asked for directions.

232296401,barrie/ca/154980/182804/232296401.html,Quality Inn,"I'm a traveling salesman and have spent much of the last 30+ years in hundreds of hotels, motels, inns & resorts across North-America. After a while, you come to expect certain things. This property was lacking severely in many areas. I would have to rate this recent stay at this particular location as being in the top 3 worst stays ever, and quite possibly THE WORST EVER! They dare to call this a Quality Inn, when it was everything but. My entire experience here was a gong show or better yet a demented nightmare! I had booked my room on business, to attend a trade show, asking for a room on the main level, so that I would have easy access to my room, being able to carry my numerous pieces of luggage in through the rear sliding window, right near my car. The hotel representative, as nice as she was, mentioned that the entire main floor was ""pet friendly"", meaning that they allowed people to bring their dogs and cats into their rooms, for an added fee. I mentioned that I had a severe cat/dog allergy, so she told me that I would have to stay on the second floor. I agreed and thanked her for letting me know. On arriving on site weeks later, I had to wait off to the side in the lobby until 3 pm sharp, before anyone at the front desk would talk to me. Three women were chatting behind the counter when I arrived, with one of them telling me to ""wait over there"" until their 3 pm ""switchover"" was complete. At 3 o'clock I approached the desk and proceeded to check in. While waiting to get my pass key, I made small talk, mentioning that I was there for the trade show, with everyone being on the main floor to do business. Mentioned that I had no choice but to go on the 2nd floor due to my pet allergies. The woman replied, stating that no, they only have about five pet friendly rooms on the main floor, with the rest of them being regular rooms with no pets allowed! The girl that took my original reservation had screwed up, so I then kindly asked that I be moved downstairs, so I could join my colleagues on the main floor, and so that I could easily unload my van of my large amount of luggage. Sorry, we're sold out and we can not move you, was her response! To add insult to injury, she told me that this hotel had decided not to install an elevator, so I would be forced to make several trips up and down a two-tier staircase, in order to get to my room. This was a royal pain in the you know what and by the time I finished I was drenched in sweat with the heart rate of a humming bird. I'm not a young man any more, so it felt like I'd just run a marathon. You think this was bad, as after this it went from bad to worse. Having worked up a sweat from having to carry all of my heavy luggage up the stairs, I decided to take a shower before joining my comrades. On entering the bathroom, I immediately saw strands of long, dark hair, on both the floor and in the sink! It was like someone had brushed their hair, with strands laying all around. I picked these up with a tissue and discarded them, and then stepped into the shower. Surprise, surprise, more long dark hair in the bathtub! The individual who cleaned the room obviously did a rush job and neglected to do her/his job. I had neither the strength nor the inclination to call the front desk, so I turned on the shower. By the time I finished showering, I had about 6 inches of water up my legs. The drain was clogged ... no doubt with more of that long dark hair! After drying off, it must have taken at least 20 minutes for the water to drain away. While standing by the sink, I then noticed very obvious wipe marks on the counter top. I wiped a bit of it with the tip of my finger and there was a dark residue. Gross. I took a tissue and wiped away the rest of the wipe marks, only to find when finished that the tissue was filthy and covered with a tan/brown scum, almost like soap scum. At this point I realized that whoever cleaned my bathroom must have allotted a maximum of 5 minutes to do what should have taken at least 15 or more. Not impressed at all. Oh ya, I almost forgot, when I finished showering, I reached for one of the large shower towels stacked behind the toilet. Was about to dry my face with it, when I noticed two large, bright red stains. This almost made me vomit. I threw it on the floor under the counter and grabbed another one, with this one being fine. Could it get any worse?! Like I said before, I've stayed in several hundred hotels over the years, and have seen a lot. This was turning into a Twilight Zone episode real fast. What took the cake, was what was to follow. On going down to the main level to visit my colleagues to talk business, I noticed that there were dozens and dozens of young guys and gals, all around 20-25 years of age. They were boisterous and looked as if they were ready to party. Boy was that an understatement! I asked at the front desk what this was all about, and they told me that there was an international broomball tournament going on in town, and that many of the hotels/motels in the area were full of these young competitors. Fast forward to 10:30, when I went to bed. This is about when the gates of hell opened up, and unfortunately they were located directly across the hall from me. I kid you not, the extremely loud party (doors slamming every minute or so, as dozens of partiers went in-and-out of the main party room, loud screaming, both male and female, cat calls, people slamming into the walls as if they were rough-housing/wrestling with each other, etc) went on until 4:30 am!!! I've never had a night from hell quite like this in my entire life. By 1 am I went out into the hall and waited for someone to slam the door again. A young man staggered out, all bleary eyed and obviously inebriated. I asked him kindly if they could try to keep it down, as others were trying to actually get some sleep. He just smiled and staggered off. And yes, I tried calling the front desk on at least 3 occasions throughout the night, with the phone never being picked up by anybody! At one point I heard an elderly woman begging one of the youngsters to keep the noise down, so she and her husband could get some sleep, that was after 2 am. Could not hear the response. The tiny bit of sleep that I did get, incorporated the loud sounds that I was hearing, often being woken up & jolted out of bed by loud screaming or cat calls. At 3 am, I heard a firm voice outside my room, and all went quiet for a while. Thank God, I thought, maybe a hotel staff member had finally actually decided to do something to remedy the situation. Within 10 minutes, the same loud screaming and bantering could be heard as if they were standing right beside my bed! They had moved the party outside, to right outside my window, which was right near my bed! Talk about bad luck, after bad luck. I guess the partiers must have finally run out of steam by 4:30 am, as everything went quiet. Unfortunately for me, my alarm was set to go off at 5 am, so I could get ready for our trade show at a nearby venue. When I got out of bed, I literally staggered, bouncing off of the walls, due to the lack of sleep. I could not think straight. After packing my bags and making the numerous needless trips up-and-down the staircase to load my vehicle, I finally approached the front desk to check out and get my invoice. There was a pleasant young fellow there, who attentively listened to my story, and was kind enough to apologize for my bad experience. Then, an older woman approached, who listened to my horror story. The expression on her face remained emotionless from start to finish, as if she were a statue. She never said a single word, not sorry to hear that, oh wow, nor anything else. She wouldn't even make eye contact with me. Unbelievable! This individual is supposed to be in customer service and be personable around people, instead she was rude and standoffish! One of the worst hotel managers that I've ever dealt with in hundreds of face-to-face meetings from Hiltons & Sheratons to Super 8s. I asked her a question a couple of times, and she would not respond, deciding to just look away and ignore me. I looked over at the young gentleman behind the desk and he smirked and rolled his eyes, as he had noticed the strange behavior on her part. I then said loudly to him ... ""I guess she's decided not talk to me"", to which neither one responded. I told them that I was checking out and wanted to get my invoice. Left the charges on my credit card and waited for my paper copy. The so-called ""manager"" shoved the bill towards me and in a mocking tone said ""have a wonderful day."" I was about to leave, but looked the bill over first, as I always tend to do before leaving a hotel. Well what do you know! She overcharged me by $100! I quickly brought this to her attention, to which she didn't even apologize! She made the correction, did not make eye contact, again, and tossed the invoice in my direction. This one individual had single-handedly guaranteed that I would never ever stay in this hotel again. I'm a member of numerous associations and clubs in the area, and I will be sure to spread the word of this terrible and terribly handled situation. Would I suggest that others stay at this location ... what do you think?!",1,negative

It reeks of chlorine the moment you walk in. The sheets have permanent stains on them; our bed was made with 4 diagonally placed pillows, 2 of which were covered in black marks (first thing I noticed when walking into the room, after the smell that is...). There's no thermostat. Like on a car, the heat is either on or off. Carpets are stained in nasty stains, especially in the hallways; they look like they've never been cleaned. Breakfast was available in a crammed closet. There were about 6 tables total. (Best part of breakfast is a bagel or toast). Our room key did not work and we were trained to make about 20 attempts before the light turned green. Overall this place is a nightmare and I feel I need to shower the minute I get home from here.",2,negative

The room was standard, but service was friendly and accommodating. We enjoyed the use of the pool and the hot tub. The room we had was on the back of the hotel away from the highway and quieter and had excellent blackout curtains which further dampened noise and light irritation while sleeping.  Only noticed that they did not have an elevator as we were lugging bags to the second floor - but we are younger travelers so this did not pose an issue.  Would recommend as a stopping point.   Two points of feedback: The breakfast space is VERY dark and could use some additional overhead lighting to improve the atmosphere.

The bed spreads where questionable about their cleanliness. The breakfast was more than continental but the breakfast area was inadequate for the amount of people who stay there, especially on weekends. The lack of a elevator was disappointing. I have to temporarily use a cane to walk around and do not need to have a handicap room so having to maneuver the stairs was challenging. Other people who have lots of luggage would find it hard as the stairwell is not very wide. Side entrance into the hotel by way of pool is also dangerous as the area always seems to be wet. The staff are friendly but could maybe be more alert to the noise level at night. On the second floor the noise level was pretty high from midnight on.

When she walked away saying I would rather smell POT then nail polish"" Im sorry its illegal and there was 16 rooms with hockey players families in all 9 year old boys and their siblings and you put three rooms with us that smoked Marijuana. and its in the hotel. the other mom turned and said "" wow the customer service around here is amazing...NOT"" Then in the morning while cleaning up the recycling bins that was in our hallway that we kindly put our empties in for them to easily clean up there was a Needle in it. What that needle was for I do not know and dont want to know! We took it to the front desk and they said Oh sorry we will take care of that.! The only think I can say good about this place was that they were awesome with us being loud in the pool the boys were loud and they allowed us to hang out in the hallways with the parents having a couple drinks so our boys could sleep and be ready for 8am games. They did have a complaint on us being loud and a gentleman from the desk with one arm just so you can give credit to where credit is deserved he was nice and said we have had a complaint can you go on the other side of the hallway doors and close them and hang out there. So we did and woke up and left the next day. I also had to wait at check out to make sure there was no damage done to my room, seemed a little weird and almost mistreated.

HIGH TIME THEY INVESTED IN MAINTENANCE OF THE ROOM HEATER/AC UNITS AND UPDATED THEM... Breakfast was dried up/rubbery with slimey cheap sausages...(perhaps stick with a waffle iron and provide boiled eggs w/bacon or ham) the .Toaster didn't work either.. You get what you pay for but there is lots of room for improvement. Id rather stay elsewhere next time.. THIS HOTEL IS SHOWING ITS AGE AND AN OBVIOUS LACK OF MAINTENANCE STAFF.

The worst breakfast I've ever had at a hotel. Eggs were chunks of rubber that did not resemble eggs in looks, texture or taste. Sausages were not cooked through. Huge line up for the one waffle machine ... Likely because nothing else was eatable.  There was not enough room to sit and eat. People were sitting on fireplace ledge, some standing.

Carpet was sopping wet from the patio door to the middle of the room, I had to wear my winter boots at all times. Patio door was so old I had to bend over and lift it to open it. Longest spider web hanging from the ceiling in the middle of the room (I don't even know how that happens!). Shower/bath had clearly not been cleaned properly in months, ceiling was significantly cracked and you could tell they had water damage. When I let my dog outside, I had to immediately call her back in because the nearby snow/lawn was FILLED with feces that had not been picked up. I called the front desk about this because it was absolutely nasty, and they did send someone who shovelled most of it.. I called the front desk 3-4 times during the night (11, 1, 2, 4), asking them to address the issue of people partying in the hallways, needless to say I didn't sleep. The lady working the front desk felt badly when I explained all this to her the next day, so she brought my rate down about 30$ and told me the manager would contact me. I have given the manager a month since my stay to contact me before posting this review, hoping they would rectify the situation appropriately, but I NEVER EVEN GOT A CALL. Needless to say that whoever decided it should be a Quality Inn had an excellent sense of humour. I will never ever stay here again, and I highly recommend you don't either.",1,negative

258573068,barrie/ca/154980/182804/258573068.html,Quality Inn,"Stayed at the Quality inn over the weekend. Staff were friendly, room was updated and clean. Hallways and pool area's is dated.  First the hallways- They are freezing- Like beyond cold, this seemed really strange. When I made a comment to a staff person she said "" Well you know, this isn't a 5 star hotel""- You know what, she was right.  Pool area- was clean, busy and the pool was freezing- I know that's subjective and perhaps my local YMCA pool is to warm, but I noticed it. Also on Friday the hot tub wasn't working but was promptly fixed and was super hot tub hot from then on. Little bit of paint peeling above the pool area. Breakfast- Was great! Hot food, that was actually hot. One waffle machine that can get a bit of a line going for it, but was good. Eggs, sausage, bagels, cereal, and juice and more- Included in the price was great. Although the area is a bit cramped. We ate early so it wasn't a problem. Sleep quality- rooms were clean and bed was comfy- The hotel got a little wild though after 10. I know there was a dance competition that weekend so lots of kids running in the halls and not using inside voices, and some out of town 20 something's looking for a good time. The staff did a good job of mitigating these people, although they were up pretty late. I thankfully slept though it. some people in rooms nearby did not though heard over breakfast. Parking was a challenge as well at night. Overall, the Quality inn was fine. Would I stay here again? Yes, yes I would. Just needs a few updates to get above my average rating, and crank the heat in the hallways.

The staff made various attempts to quiet the loud guests down, It did get quiet- till 3 am, then it ramped up again! I called the front desk and complained,but not much changed.there was a dance competition and girls running all over the place- some were practicing there routine till 11pm in the room above us. Also large group of 20-somethings- screaming, ranting and slamming doors the remainder of the night. The nice beds were the only good thing. Why don't hotels block off a wing for these events? Mosltly I blame poor parental/chaperone supervision. Won't stay here again!

276278318,barrie/ca/154980/182804/276278318.html,Quality Inn,"Stayed for a youth sports tournament in May, and I reserved 2 rooms , one for myself and one for another friend, under their name. Upon I arrival I checked in without an issue and paid debit. The next day I received a phone call from the front desk clerk, Dorothy, saying that myself and the other room that I was with need to immediately go down to the front desk to complete payment or else we would be kicked out of our rooms. After repeatedly explaining over the phone to her the we both paid upon check in and to please look into it, we were very rudely still forced to go to the front desk and discuss this further. After I arrive to the front desk and again explained to her that we had already paid and showed our receipt, she still rudely threatened that if we did not pay, we would be removed from the premises. She then FINALLY looked into it and realized that both payments were wrongly posted to my room and that in fact we were already paid in full. Upon figuring out the problem she then exclaimed, ""Oh I didn't even look at your records, before calling and insisting that you come down."" Terrible way to treat customers before even looking into the issue at hand. This put a damper on an otherwise good still. The rest of the staff was friendly, the room was clean and comfortable, the pool area was small but clean, and the breakfast was good even though there wasnt enough food for everyone.

277958272,barrie/ca/154980/182804/277958272.html,Quality Inn,"This was not the hotel I was expecting and I won't return.  You have little control over how your guests behave and as a result I was up most nights. From young adults partying in your parking lot the first night I arrived to the room above me jumping and then a nice woman decided to let the whole place know she was enjoying her stay be ""screaming with excitement"" in the middle of the night and causing my youngest who i had just gotten to sleep, wake in terror. You may not be able to control every guests but the noise level is far to loud even during a week stay.  You also may wish to address a certain staff who has attitude and carries it forth the following day when she sees you after you lodged a complaint about the noise your first night in as well as an unwanted bevy on your door step as you go to the front desk to lodge your complaint. I don't know this girl's name but the way she handle the situation, spoke to me and then proceeded to glare at me the next evening was not the way a staff should act. Not to mention when I brought to her attention that fact that the sign for the out of order ice machine was still posted confusing guests and offering to bring it to her she slyly replied with an ""I'll get it later"" and I come to find it is still there yet have used the ice machine just fine. I question if she takes pride in her work because this does not scream pride to me.   Your only positives are the pool and breakfast. Both I had no complaints. I must say the older ladies at the desk showed me they know how to take pride in there work so thumbs up to them. While the rooms are clean and the beds are nice you could do with some fine combing with dust and wear and tear on the rooms. I normally don't judge this but a nice stained wall beside my bed had me wonder. Although I wouldn't blame your housekeeping because speaking to them told me they don't have enough time especially on the weekends after bar central to clean as well as they would like. I appreciate they did their best to keep our room fresh and they should be praised for this!  You should address parking. While you have plenty, you have guests parking more then one vehicle in spots that should be for the room that is right near the spaces. Several times we could not access the space in front of our room which resulted in parking out front most of the time.  Sadly you dropped the ball and for this I won't be returning.

282387125,barrie/ca/154980/182804/282387125.html,Quality Inn,"I stayed here with my family for two nights as part of a larger group that was in town for a tournament. Although our experience was not a good one, I'll try and give a balanced review.  PROS: Free food and beverages in the room (fridge comes pre-stocked), newly painted rooms, extra cleaning products in the bathroom, free wi-fi, free breakfast for 2, and personal service on checkout.  CONS: The free food and beverages aren't fresh. We found food under our beds (I am guessing they were chunks of cookies, but to be honest I didn't try them so I can't say for sure), and beer in the fridge when we arrived. The beer wasn't exactly a high quality beer (i.e. crappy) so I also did not partake, but apparently the people before us had a wider selection than what was left because they left the beer caps in the room (on the floor, just like the food). Even if the beer was good it wasn't cold because the fridge was turned off and it took several hours to cool. When I filled up our cooler to keep our food cold overnight, I was told by the front desk staff to try and limit how much ice I took because they had 90+ rooms to serve with that ice machine. As a recommendation I would suggest 1. buying another ice machine; 2. fixing the fridges; 3. knocking off the second level of the hotel. I'll leave the decision to management. As an aside they were concerned the fridge wasn't working, but that's were it ended.  The front lobby and rooms appear to have been renovated relatively recently. Upon check-in the hotel has a decent front lobby appearance. The rooms are another story. They are reasonably updated, but not clean. Our room had red stains on the wall, and I assumed it was some sort of tomato-based food product because the alternatives are just not pleasant. We reported this on the first day and when we checked out they were still there. We wondered how these marks were not washed away until we found the cleanser bottle the room staff use, in the bathroom. I understand that sometimes things may be forgotten, but when you get to the next room and realize you don't have the cleaning solution, wouldn't you try and find it. Based on the cleanliness of the room I would guess no. And that explains the wall stains.  Apparently there is free wi-fi. I say 'apparently' because it is listed on the sign out front, and when I tried to access it I was given several options to choose from. Unfortunately none of these seemed to work. Maybe I was out of reach for the signal, but I would think that the service area would cover my room (maybe that is just expecting too much). Interestingly, others in our party were able to access the free wi-fi. They did this by standing outside and using the Best Western service, which is right next door.  Breakfast is fine, nothing remarkable: bagels, cereals, waffles (make your own) and on the days we were there the hot foods were sausages and eggs. However, there were several things about the breakfast service that make the 'free' description seem like you are overpaying. The toaster took several minutes to toast a bagel. Not sure how long exactly, but several people got their breakfast while I waited for one bagel, and that did not make anyone happy. On day 2 the bread and bagel rack was empty so I asked if the breakfast staff could see if there were more. Judging by her pained reaction you'd have thought I asked for her to make the bread from scratch. After getting breakfast I would recommend that you go back to your room. I didn't count the seats in the breakfast area, but I would estimate there was room for about 2 people (or maybe 4 children). You would think for the number of times that the staff told me how many rooms they had to take care of, this would have been a consideration in designing the breakfast area. If you have 90+ rooms, make a breakfast area that can handle the number of people you would expect to have breakfast. I understand that sometimes the breakfast area will fill up, but with so few tables and chairs I can't imagine a time when that area would not be at capacity.  I have stayed in many hotels and this is the only one in recent memory that I can think of that does not have a self checkout option. Actually, to be totally fair they do have that option. If you don't want to wait in line at the front desk, you can just leave and they will bill your credit card. You don't get to see the bill though because you have to get in line for that ('why would you need to see the bill?' was the reaction when we asked about this). When we suggested that they might want to slide the bill under the door so people can leave without having to go to the front desk, and be assured their bill is correct, the reaction was one of stunned disbelief. So, at checkout be prepared to get in line with people from 90+ rooms.  I see from other negative reviews that the hotel manager/owner posts a reply asking for people to get in contact to discuss the service. I suspect the same thing may happen here, but I think that is a bit disingenuous. We reported the problems noted above during our stay and nothing happened during the stay. On day one we said the room was unclean, and on day 2 we found more food on the floor and the stains were still on the wall. At checkout we reported our concerns to the front desk staff and they offered $25 off. When we asked if that was per night, we were told no, and had to argue that point. In the end we did get $50 off our bill (and I am happy to recognize that concession) and were told that the front staff would 'face the boss' over this. I would hope that the woman who checked us out does not get into trouble for making this concession, and would suggest that the boss start showing up for checkouts so that they can face these comments.

This is the first time we've used the pool. It was a good size considering, but it could definitely have used a good cleaning. The hotel was completely sold out and quite a few people using it each time we peaked in so I imagine this had some thing to do with it. Our check in was quick and easy, the room was very clean, and smelled good. We had a great nights sleep and had everything we needed :) the batteries in the TV remote were dead, so I left a note for housekeeping in the morning.  The breakfast area is small, with a full hotel, there's not a lot of options to sit. I got my food and took it back to my room. It wasn't the fanciest breakfast ever, but certainly nothin to complain about. Especially given the lower cost of staying here.  Our morning check out, was great. The woman who worked the counter (white hair, glasses, and I think had a wrist brace on..) was absolutely a doll. It was pouring rain, the original plans we had to do something outdoors before heading home, clearly wasn't happening. She offered suggestions for activities in the area that were indoors, showed us information on the circus and pointed out coupons to save money. She was pleasant, friendly, and so helpful. It's things like that (for me) that make a stay better than 'it was clean and breakfast was good'. I left with a smile on my face because of everything, but especially with how I left, feeling like even though I had paid, and on my way out, my experience was still important to her.

We weren't adverse to going, but it didn't meet our expectations at all in the end.   It was obvious there had been a recent renovation and the lobby and breakfast area look very nice. The rooms have been redone, but they haven't really been finished well - the bathrooms have nice tiles in them, but there are large gaps between the tiles and the wall that have not been finished with caulking or other trim and the trim behind the bathroom door is not finished either. There is a patio door on the main floor rooms (which ours was) and the door was not updated with the room - it doesn't open well, the paint on the trip is chipped and the door is just in generally poor repair.  The beds were comfortable, which was important and one of the few positives. There is a small fridge and microwave in each room - our fridge didn't work, which we discovered when we came back late at night and found the fridge to be very warm inside and had items left in it from the guests before us. It was disgusting. We notified the front desk in the morning and they did repair it, but didn't remove the items that were in the fridge - not pleasant. This, combined with a mystery yellow-orange goop that was splattered on the wall and the arm chair in the room, just made me wonder about the cleanliness of the hotel overall. It was very obvious and hard to imagine that housekeeping staff would not have noticed it when turning the room after the previous guests. (Again, when we noted this to the front desk, they did clean up the mystery goop.)   We did get a discount on our room, but only after complaining and insisting on a discount. It was not offered, despite staff telling us that a note was being placed on our file and that we would be looked after upon check out.

Room had a chemical deodorizer smell through it, some funky stains on the carpet, and needs some TLC. Was fine for the price paid, as I got a good rate through AAA. The card keys are really strange. The breakfast was okay, nothing to write home about, but then again a ""free"" breakfast, shouldn't be complaining.   As a quick place to stop, okay...but not a destination holiday place that is for sure.

Before we left our city we called about getting a cot in one of the rooms. After several times calling as no one answered and when they did we were placed on hold for 15 minutes we finally had some assistance. We were told there was no problem that they can add one for 10.00 a night. When we arrived there was no cot just a 2 inch 3 cushion matress that looks like cushions off a couch to lay on the floor. I was upset how is my son suppose to sleep on this? When we went to the desk they said sorry we don't carry any other cots this is all we offer and they did not bill me for it, however if I would of known I would of booked a place where he did have a bed. Next the cleaning staff need to be fired or trained to clean a room other then vaccum and make a bed. The room smelled off and there was dust and dirt all over everything. We had to wipe down the dresser top when we got there and it was horrible. The whole time we were there they never refilled the coffee in the room. We were told to go down stairs when we wanted one. We had an issue with our keys the whole time we were there and had them replaced 6 times and even switched rooms and yet still an issue. In fact the biggest let down was when we came back from wonderland we found both our rooms doors were left wide open by the cleaning staff. Thankfully we didn't notice anything missing however we still don't know if anyone went through our rooms. There is no elevator so those with disabilties or lots of luggage get a ground floor room.  Breakfast was fine and the food was good however it is very small sitting area and my younger daughter was refused breakfast as she didn't have her shoes on. Yet there were other families there doing the same thing. All in all this will probably be my last time using a quality inn as to me it was not worth the price we paid. We were offered an 80.00 discount off our entire stay for the rooms being opened however I personally feel it should be more or offered something else.",2,negative

Parking is free and there was many spots available. We had a second floor room despite requesting a ground floor one. Such is the way things go when booking through a third party.  Our room was spacious and clean. It featured two large beds with adequate bed linens, multiple pillows and good quality pillow topped mattresses.  The bathroom was clean and well stocked with toiletry items and plenty of towels. Everything worked well and was in good order. The TV was a larger flat-screen and featured local cable only. No pay-per-view was offered.  The microwave and small fridge are good for cooling off drinks or heating up snacks . There was a desk to sit at but only one chair ,no table to eat at. The HVAC unit is bit noisy as it it and older unit. It did work how ever and supplied some fresh air. The window opens a bit but the road noise is ever-present so that was not a good option. The breakfast was typical of a 'free-hot' ,scrambled eggs , sausages & waffles. The little eating area was quite full and there are not too many seats for the numbers of diners . The food was good enough. recommend adding more selections and enlarging the area . The lady running the breakfast area was quite nice and went the extra to make everyone's meal as good as it could be. even reopening after the cut off to get a little something for the late arrivers. The pool area was very clean and well stocked with towels. The pool its-self was tepid in temperature and the liner is wrinkled along the bottom . Not the best swimming experience. The hot tub is quite nice however,so on balance good enough. The hotel is just off of the 400 @ highway 90/ Dunlop St ,so easy drive to Base Borden and direct access to old downtown Barrie and its beaches.  As it was only around 80$CDN for a double with a pool/hot tub with free-hot breakfast and free parking ,it has to be regarded as a good deal. That having been said, I'd look around a bit more. This hotel is not necessarily the best in Barrie,but not the worst by a long shot. Cheers.

First couple of days we were leaving with our friend but for remaining two days we had to shift out - as his couple of relatives had arrived. Due to this last minute mess up of plan - we wanted to stay somewhere close to his place - that is around Dunlop Street and this place seemed most convenient.   Being quite cost effective and convenient - we booked this place and it turned out to be quite good (would say probably we were lucky). This place isn't like a le meridian or jw marriot but it's great for price. Service was very warm and nice. Complimentary Breakfast had limited spread but was tasty. As we were staying here for different reason - we had breakfast only for one day and we quite liked it. WiFi was quite high speed with good connectivity.   The bed seemed new and were quite comfortable. As we did check in at very short notice , rooms were dirty and we had to wait for around 30 minutes for rooms to be cleaned up. But I guess it's more cos of us then hotel.

Don't know if the previous guests were smoking in the room or not but there was no way we could handle the odor. The hotel was quick to provide an alternate room on the second floor (no elevator). The second room was roomy, clean and comfortable with no smell of smoke and the beds were comfortable.   We usually stay and Hilton properties and found the breakfast here to be not up to the standards we are used to. That being said we were able to have toast and cereal. The hot food looked like scrambled powered eggs and overly greasy sausages - it just didn't appeal.

It was very noisy with children running in the halls in the early morning and voices in the hallway carried very easily into the room.

I'm a bit of a nature lover so I like the fact that it was close to the waters, but it was also close to malls which gave my wife a big smile for the 3 days and 2 nights of our stay there.   However, what really got me and my wife was the people working there. They were very nice (which is not surprising coming from Canadians) and were very attentive to their customers' needs.  The rooms were fairly big and very clean (which is one of the things I look at when I enter a room).   This hotel ticked all of the boxes. Two thumbs up!

Three days were for sightseeing and one day for partaking in various local activities.   We chose Quality Inn Barrie for a brief two-day-stay in Ontario, Canada. However, we extended our staying time here for their awesome customer service, excellent room service, modern amenity, and true hospitality. Staffs were amiable, attentive and responsive. Both I and my partner liked their complimentary hot breakfast, contemporary interior design, and neat and clean rooms. This was probably the best staying in my life. It was clean, serene, relaxing and amusing.   Well decorated interior coupled with a pleasant environment evoked a different kind of sentiment in us to enjoy the place with our hearts’ content. This uniquely styled, perfectly designed and conveniently located Inn features an easy access to beautiful beaches, long walking trails and a few places of attractions nearby. At night, a distant view of it from the beautiful downtown seemed to me an emerald beauty surrounded by greeneries from all sides. It played a great role to help us enjoy the picturesque landscape, wonderful vista and outstanding panoramic view of Ontario.   We enjoyed our staying and felt it like our own home far away from our original dream home. Beautiful living atmosphere, modern amenities and convenient location have made the place perfect for comfortable living. Rooms are bigger and well decorated. Almost of them are well equipped with modern furniture, and cutting-electronic appliances like Flat TV, Refrigerator, Telephone, Air Conditioning, Water Heater, Coffee Machine, etc. They provided us with Wi-Fi internet connection and hot water.    If I go to Ontario at any occasion, I will surely take a chance to stay there again.

Well, based on our experience, we couldn't have been more satisfied, and, very pleased. The room was a good size, and, very clean. Nothing too fancy. And, the beds were very comfortable, along with the pillows. The TV screen was a good size, and, the remote control was really easy to use. The bathroom was clean, and, a reasonable size. The staff (Dorothy and Heather (?) could not have been nicer, and more welcoming, and, just plain friendly. We felt like we were really appreciated as valued guests, and, not just as sales to process. Plus, the complimentary breakfast was surprisingly nutritious, and, the scrambled eggs were very tasty.  And, best of all, when we were concerned about possibly being hit by a major snowstorm while attending the morning funeral service, and, so, unable to return to our home city, Dorothy re-assured us that if we were stuck, just, come on back, and, they'd be happy to provide us with another comfortable room, to ride out the storm. That support was very re-assuring. As it happened, we were just able to return home, about an hour ahead of the storm, so, it worked out. But, it sure helped to know we would be welcome, if needed.  So, bottom line--if you are looking for a basic, comfortable, clean, best value for the dollar visit to Barrie, Ontario, then, rest assured, if you stay here, at this Quality Inn, you will truly be satisfied.

Everything in the room was new and the TV was large. Based on the walls/carpet the hotel was a bit older but for over night can't complain. Bathroom was brand new and bed was comfortable. Staff was very nice upon check in. Stayed on a weekday so it seemed to be many people just staying over for trade work so everyone was in bed early it seems.,4,positive

When I got home, I put all of our clothes in the washer. The smell was like the worst body odor you can imagine. They were trying to cover it up by using a spray or something, which just made it worse. You could literally smell it coming off the carpet. If we had not arrived so late at night, we would have left and went to another hotel. We slept with towels lining the bed.

Staff upon check in was lovely and patient. This is where the story takes a turn for the worse. I was staying with a friend of mine and my very tired two year old, there were a lot of people drinking and partying however they weren't too loud at bedtime and we were able to get some sleep. Some idiot drunk person decided to pull The fire alarm at 2:40am and since we were on the 2nd floor and it wasn't going off we thought better safe than sorry and took my half asleep two year old out into the rain. The lobby and front were filled with drunk patrons and a very intoxicated woman began bothering my little one despite her friends telling her to leave us alone then she got into a fight with another drunk patron who swore in front of us so we had to run back into the hotel with the alarms still ringing in order to not be caught in a fight between two people over my child. Manager said there was no fire and to go back to our room. This is where it gets scary. The deadbolts on the door don't work which made us leery, ffwd 3 minutes and some horribly drunk 6 foot tall man proceeds to bang on our door, I yelled through the door for him to leave and he went across the hall and banged on their door. He then proceeded to come back to our door and start body slamming it trying to get into our room and I again yelled at him to go away and throughout all this my two year old is crying because he's scared. My friend opened the door and told him to leave so he again went across the hall and this time managed to push his way into the room and the guests had to push him out of their room. He then came back to our room and again tried to gain entry. We finally were able to get a hold of front desk who were able to resolve the situation but not even 5 minutes later another drunk guy starts banging on doors again. He managed into his room and we fell asleep around 4:30 am. Not pleasant and actually a very nerve wracking situation. Upon check out the manager offered me a discount off my room after I politely explained to her what happened with the other guests (fire alarm not their fault) and I appreciated the generosity. Would I stay here again? Possibly, but perhaps they should organize the rooms a bit better when they get their bookings that say they have children so at least there can be a quieter spot?",3,negative

Very conveniently close to the Highway 400. As usual the rooms were great and it was quiet. The pool and hot tub was great to relax in after a long drive. I have read many of the comments left by other travelers and I have to say I have never had any of those problems with this Inn and this is my second visit there and would most certainly return.

393665972,barrie/ca/154980/182804/393665972.html,Quality Inn,"We booked, and unfortunately pre-paid, for a one night stay during a road trip to Niagara Falls this summer. Upon arrival, I went to check in and was given a key to a room on the 1st floor, down the hall from the front desk. I headed down the hall and let myself into the room. As I entered, I noticed that the bed looked as if someone had slept in it. Then I noticed a purse on the couch and realized that someone was in the shower! I immediately left the room and headed back to the front desk. The clerk there said that she tried to catch me but I had already entered the room. She said that they must have changed the room we were assigned but didn't make the change in the computer. Whatever. She apologized and gave me keys to a new room further down the hall. When I entered that room I felt as if I had stepped into an episode of ""Hotel Hell""! The room was filthy! The carpet was so dirty that I would never consider taking off my shoes! There were stains all over the couch, the curtains were dirty and falling apart with hems undone and sagging off the rod. The sliding door was unable to shut all the way with dirt and bugs getting in. I didn't bother to check what shape the bathroom was in as I knew there was no way we were staying in that room.  We were thinking that it would be worth it to accept the loss of the cost of a night's stay and go somewhere else - that is how bad it was. When I returned to the front desk AGAIN, I asked if all the rooms were like that and then listed the issues that I noticed. The lady at the desk apologized and gave me keys to another room at the end of the hall on the 2nd floor to check out to see if it was satisfactory. This 3rd room was definitely better, at least I felt safe that the door would lock, the bathroom was decently clean, and the room appeared to be clean. We ended up staying in that room for the night and leaving as soon as we could the next morning. The best thing about staying at this hotel....was leaving it. I'm shocked that they are allowed to operate as a Quality Inn! Be warned.  We will never return and likely won't ever stay at another Quality Inn.",1,negative

Even though I am a sound sleeper, I was awakened several times before the front desk finally put a stop to it.   In terms of amenities, the breakfast area is very limited in space and tables which can give you a bit of stress to start your day waiting for a table.

The extra item that I didn't expect but found in the room was free wireless internet access. Overall for a budget motel there were many positive points.  As for the negatives, the property is located very close to the freeway so you will likely hear the noise of cars zooming by in your room.

It had started to snow, and we hadnt planned to stop but were both very tired so decided to find a hotel to sleep for the night. TomTom showed that this one was near where we were on the highway, so we turned up and asked if they had a room for the night.   Jake, the guy behind the desk, couldnt have been more helpful. We checked in at about 10 in the evening, and he did everything quickly and with no fuss; the fact we also had our pet cat with us didnt faze him at all, in fact he gave us a small bag of treats for him! Top marks to Jake for customer service; after a tiring and stressful day where all we wanted was to get some sleep, he was a ray of sunshine, especially at that time of night.  The room was clean and functional, all linens crisp and clean, we had a non smoking room with a queen sized bed. The only slight niggle was the pillows; they felt like sleeping on bags of chopped up rubber sliced bread, for want of a better description.   Apart from that, everything was great. Had a great night's sleep, and check out was a breeze. The bill was popped under the door whilst we slept so we didnt need to go through checking out before we left, all we had to do was return the key.  This hotel is pet friendly which is an absolute boon. We normally stay at Best Westerns, but none of them in the area were pet friendly. And when you are travelling from one end of the country to the other, and have your pet with you, they need to relax too, and the last thing you need is the hassle of trying to find somewhere that is happy to accommodate a small cat. Jake even waived the normal $10 pet fee because of our late check in.  Breakfast is included, as is high speed internet, in the price. I would definitely stay at this hotel again.",5,positive

I also still don't get why the Christmas lights are left on year round, its very tacky.   I would only recommend this hotel if the price was $60 or less. Theres no pool/spa or anything to really relax you. The beds are worn and the walls need repairs. Stains on ceiling. Things you wouldn't expect in a room costing $90 a night.

What I mean is, they have all the things you might expect from a nice 3 star hotel, but only the cheap versions. Cheap breakfast, furniture, room maintenance. Wouldn't it be better to start with what you would expect in a 2 star hotel and be the best at that? Be like a Super 8, but better, rather than like a Hilton Garden Inn, but not quite as nice.  Anyways, this place was reasonably clean, comfortable, etc, no real problems. WiFi was actually REAL high speed, very good. Breakfast was OK, but the hotel really wasn't built to include breakfast.

An hour later there were about 8 construction worker-types smoking a joint and playing music in the parking lot. Maybe this is a regular party hotel? I can also see the place getting more used feel to it if the maintainance isn't kept up. I stayed in room 231. The air conditioner woke me up several times throughout the night and the sink drained slowly. Also the bathroom tissue roll fell out of the holder twice with no provocation. Not major problems but add a couple more things like this and it starts to feel like the place is on the slide to a slummy hotel.  I will stay here again when I'm in Barrie on business again.,3,negative

And by welcoming, I do not mean that they simply accept pets but the staff enjoys having them there, providing cookies to welcome them at the front desk and keeping the pet fee very inexpensive. I agree with all of the previous reviews, that the staff are very friendly and helpful.  The Comfort Inn is a great place to crash for the night.

Continental breakfast was fine. The 2nd day of our stay we phoned to the front desk at about 10:00 am, and left a voice message 'to please make up our room'. When we returned late that night our room hadn't been touched and my wife went down to get clean towels etc. The front desk staff apologized and were very sorry, but... As i said, it was just okay and only if you wanted a place to lie your head at night. I don't think I would stay there again. I would rate it 2 to 2.5 stars and I usually don't stay in anything under 3 stars.

Comfort Inn was pet friendly and offered the convenience of drive up rooms. It was the worse experience that my wife and I have ever had. We had a spider on the bed. Then when we saw that we decided to pull the blankets back only to see that the bed had not been changed from the previous guest. The lady at the front desk was very accomodating and changed the bedding for us. We also were put in between drunken ignorant construction workers who stood out there rooms drinking. When we pulled into our parking spot at our door all of these drunks would intentionally stand there and just ogle my wife. Don't get me wrong I think my wife looks good too and I understand guys are going to look but this was over board. If I went to the vehicle one of them would intentionally walk by the room and look into the room.to see if he could see my wife.

The room was lovely and clean (a rarity in 2/2.5 star hotels). The internet worked well and was easy to connect to. Front desk was polite and helpful at all times. Bed was comfortable and pillows were excellent. I genuinely have no complaints. Breakfast had a great variety including the basics, waffles, yogurt and hot items. There was also lots of parking and the hotel was easy to find. It is next to the highway but the noise didn't seem to carry in.   The worst I can say is that they might want to use slightly less laundry soap as the sheets did have a strong soap odor (but were not scratchy or over starched). The only bars to this hotel being 3 stars are that it is a motel, it uses traditional rather than duvet bedding and the furniture is classic functional rather than trendy.   I did have an issue with drunken people across the hall being very loud. Front desk responded and police were called. It took some time to be dealt with but the hotel responded promptly and responsibly.   I got a discounted room rate - given other prices in the area the full price I found didn't seem out of line with my experience.",5,positive

My wife was disappointed that there was no pool or spa, but for those amenities, the nearest Hotel wanted much more. We were there primarily to sleep. Going to a Christmas party and driving back to Toronto was out of the question. We were fortunate enough to get a ground floor drive up room, a big plus for us, as my wife is partially disabled. After we checked in, the first thing I noticed was the nice flat screen TV with such a terrible picture, I could not watch it. I looked behind the TV and found that the cable was connected to the TV via a splitter with another cable to the wall plate with old ""crimp-on"" connectors, and they were all loose. I'm in the telecommunications industry, so I went to the truck, made a new cable, connected it to the TV and WALLA!! beautiful picture!. I didn't have the heart to tell them what I had done when I checked out, I just figured someone would see it and wonder how that happened. All in all, it was a good, but very brief stay.

We ended up booking a smoking room by accident (our fault we didn't read the description when originally booking online), the front desk clerk mentioned that unfortunately they were booked so she could not move us to another room (very sweet that that was even an option if it was less busy). However, the room was not dirty or have a smoke smell to it so it wasn't even noticeable that we had booked a smoking room.  The hotel was close to downtown, however it was too far to walk (especially since it was cold out) so we took a cab downtown and back which maybe cost us $20 round trip, including tip.  The hotel room had a fridge and microwave in the room which was also a nice treat as many hotels these days do not have these or you are charged extra to use them.

300279141,barrie/ca/154980/184053/300279141.html,Comfort Inn - Barrie / Hart Dr.,"OK, this wasn’t my idea but they have a variety of ice cream in the breakfast buffet and not the cheap stuff. Probably causes more problems than it solves after watching moms trying to get the kids to eat sausages and eggs when the ice cream is right next to it. Yes, this is your somewhat less than average Comfort Inn. There are 2 in town, this is the cheaper one and for a reason. Not a lot of amenities, as in none, but a great value for the money. It’s much nicer than those cheap roadside rest motels and maybe $25 more expensive. Comfortable rooms, fridge, microwave, everything worked OK. Plumbing was less than perfect. Seems to be noisy if people were in the hallway, but overall, if price is concern, the best room for the price in the area and I've staying in many, if you can get it because price varies A LOT. It’s easy to see the hotel along the freeway but you have to take the service road to get there. Maybe a little over 5 minutes to downtown. Plenty of parking. Dog friendly I believe. For a good price, I'd stay again. Note that I pre-booked and never dealt with any staff

300287038,barrie/ca/154980/184053/300287038.html,Comfort Inn - Barrie / Hart Dr.,"The bathroom was disgusting. There was a thick layer of dirt crusted onto the edge of the boarder of the floor, all around the bathroom. The back of the door for the bathroom was covered in dirt and you could see hand prints and finger prints. There were burn marks on the counter in the bathroom. The ceiling in the bathroom was covered in dirt. One of the towels had pubic hair on it. We stayed in the smoking room (we were non smokers) and when we arrived the front desk agent made us wait in the lobby as he sprayed the room with some sort of chemical spray to cover the smoke smell in the room, which in turn flared up my allergies. Their were burn marks on the bed covers. The fridge had not been turned on before our arrival, so the fridge was warm. This was most likely the worst stay at any hotel, ever.",1,negative

Everything was good except for the heavy musty smell when we walked into the room. Not sure why it smelled that way but it was very noticeable and only went away after a few hours of air conditioning use. My pet peeve is loose bathroom fixtures and the bathroom sink fixture is about to fall off in the room we rented on the 2nd floor. Clean, comfortable, great beds and pillows, this is very much in line with other Comfort Inns we have stayed at. Hot breakfast was ok at best as the hot portion was sausage patties and (I imagine!)  some kind of omelette round shaped disk the colour of eggs or hot Instant oats. Coffee a plenty and some bananas, apples, along with 3-4 different flavoured yogourts. Many different cereal, sure to please kids were offered as well. Bagels, english muffins, breads of different kinds to toast, juices, milk and a friendly atmosphere in the dining room all made for a nice breakfast.
 
 
 Room Tip:  No elevator so main floor rooms are better if you have a lot of luggage.

Since we couldn't sleep all night we left early in the morning and once again complained to the staff at front desk and all they could say was oh well nothing we can do about it.

It was almost at a Hampton level quality with its new renovations, complimentary breakfast and upgraded simple yet very clean lobby and dining area.  The rooms has a very modern feel to them despite the antiquated AC system which they really should work on next.

It really made me mad that the lady this morning disputed my word and said she was going to add another $10 to my bill after I already received my express checkout receipt. If I pass thru Barrie I'm not staying there again. I'll check out Quality Inn. It looks so much better from outside. Photos online are deceiving!!!! I'll have to talk with my credit card company about that extra charge. This place is outrageous in the rates compared to all other hotels I've been booking.

We booked a Ski Discovery package that gave us a Parlour Suite with 2 Queen Beds, Breakfast, unlimited Alpine Lift Tickets, Rentals and a daily lesson.  The Room - the suite was roomy with a sunken area with a desk, 2 chairs and fireplace and the bathroom had a HUGE tub, smallish shower with awesome pressure and a dated t.v. We found it comfortable and clean with slightly dated decor.  Meals - not much at the resort so we took all meals at the Crazy Horse where the staff were so friendly and kind. Food was pub style and family friendly. We brought snacks, wine and beer for our room. It is a 5 minute drive to a grocery store/liqour store if you need anything. The resort also has a cafeteria and few consession stands for easy eating. Each nite at the Crazy Horse was a theme such as all you can eat pasta bar, Hamburger nite and so on.  Skiing - beginner hills with great staff getting everyone moving with lessons and equipment. The instructor Edgar got us skiing and on the hills super fast, great teacher. Lots of schools roll in as it is close to Toronto so we headed out early and took our breaks when things got a bit busy on the hill.  Extras - Pool was clean and great, there is tubing and a zip line but we were there to ski so we did not try these out.  Summary - this is a great place, the reviews are a tad harsh on the rooms, yes its dated but ours was in great shape, clean and the beds were comfortable as can be (husband with bad back says thumbs up!). I suspect the lower price rooms are beat up due to lots of use each winter but there are scheduled renovations coming up.

When you turn it on, you have the choice of previewing various channels. We chose a free preview of music (free for 4 minutes) and then proceeded to dress for dinner. A voice came on stating that our preview period was over. We shut the TV off soon after and went for dinner. We found out the next day upon checkout that we were billed over $11.00 for 2 minutes of music. Isn't that negative billing option outlawed in Ontario? We never agreed to keep going with the music. The staff the next morning was unhelpful -- or didn't care. Since they have our credit card number, not much else to be done. The whole system is a throwback to the 1980's.

We were hooked up in harnesses and climbed 60 ft. and higher to platforms built into trees in a forest. We then traversed across thin wires from tree to tree. Sometimes we had to go over rickety bridges other times we went zipping from tree to tree on lines that were 50 or maybe 100 feet long!!!! This was a complete blast. One must make sure of several conditions. Foremost, one must pay close attention to the instructions given on clipping and unclipping the carabiners(sp). Your well being is truly in your own hands so you do not want to make any mistakes. Secondly, you must be in very, very good physical condition. Also, one should either not be afraid of heights or at least be able to control one's fear enough to be able to participate. Finally, the age limits are truly for the childrens' safety. I wanted my 9 year old to participate so badly but she wasn't tall enough. She had to go on the childrens' course. At first I was disappointed but it really was the best for her. She never would have been able to reach high enough to get through the course. Also, the childrens' course was wonderfully challenging for her and her 2 friends who are a little older. Our daughter is very capable of anything physical...the adult course would have been way too much for her. I was miffed at first about the staff not allowing her to participate in the adult course but now knowing what I know I am grateful. Another item to consider is to wear gloves. Leather gloves would be best but any hand covering where you can still manuever one's fingers would be smart to wear. Also, do not wear jewelry especially earrings. Tie up long hair. Additionally, there are no lockers or anything to put your belongings in so bring nothing with you.  It was buggy so I suggest bug spray. The staff are young and enthusiastic. They are patient and kind. We tipped them $30.00 for the three of us...they deserved more! Plan on showering after. Have such a great time. I know I shall never forget this experience. It truly was indescribable.  As for the room...it was ok. The bathroom was clean. The sheets were clean. The pillows were awful foam ones. The room was a very, very basic 3 star.

The entire resort is very secluded. When you come upon it, it is very surprising to see such a resort along a very woody and weedy road. It is a very easy drive, off of Route 400. Although we stayed at the Inn, there are also ""Lodges"" and a sister hotel, the Carriage Resort, on the same property. The amenities were a plus -- a large, clean exercise room with two ellipticals, two treadmills, and a fitness machine with resistance weights (although there were no free weights). There was a nice indoor pool (although the hot tub flowed into it, making it quite warm) and an outdoor pool, with hours from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m. There was a ""saloon"" that looked friendly and a nice restaurant (we didn't eat there). We did eat at the western restaurant and the fare was OK, but kind of pricey for sandwiches and appetizers; it was definitely in need of some renovation but mostly clean and friendly -- and convenient right on site. There was a nice bar off the lobby and a coffee bar in the lobby. The grounds were kept very clean and parking was free and right outside the door. The best part was feeling very safe in the surroundings -- although it was in the middle of nowhere, the site itself was busy and safe. The Valley golf course surrounded the Inn and we had to drive a couple of miles to get to play the Highlands course -- it was very nice and challenging. We also found many lovely new homes surrounding the course and, virtually surrounding the resort but not within sight -- very affluent neighborhoods but not visible from the main road. If you are looking to golf, try the Valley course since it is right at the Inn unless you really want to be challenged by the Highlands course. Or maybe try both.   The regular ""Horseshoe"" room was plenty big enough for four of us -- me, my husband and my two grown sons, 18 and 20. It was very clean; the bathroom was roomy (although the sink was not separate) and the air was controlled by a thermostat and worked beautifully and quietly. The inn was definitely renovated recently; I am very picky and I would not hesitate to visit the Horseshoe again -- the 1.5 hour drive from Toronto is worth it -- but stay at least two nights to enjoy all there is to offer.",4,positive

We booked the room for the horseback riding they offer here and they didn't have it during the weekdays so we had to make a 30minute trip to Highview farms. When we arrived we wanted to bike ride in the area as its a very nice place especially for bike riding - but turns out their bike rentals aren't even open during the week. We got hungry and checked out the menu at Crazy Horse and Silk Lounge but where not impressed for dinner items - so we took the car and traveled to Orilia for Boston Pizza. Overall our trip was great since we got to check out the nice views of Barrie and surrounding areas, Highview Farms,Orilia and had a good room. The roads and the amount of green we saw here was just amazing all within the vicinity of this resort. The resort itself would have been great had they had their activities open like horses, bikes and other stuff they promote to be open. As for the resort room itself - it was huge.

We even had ANTS in our room....Gross! In contrast we were in rooms that looked like they had been renovated in the past couple of years...and they were not too bad...  Also, for those of you thinking of using the Wedding Services....Beware! The ""Wedding Planner"" or so she called herself seemed very new and disorganized....not good!

Unfortunately the place has severely gone downhill over the past couple years which is upsetting because it was such a nice place I would take my family a couple times a year.  The ""adventure"" park that is opened is a total joke. Everything is severely overpriced. I think they are trying to get their return on investment within the first year. Not even close to worth it. The gates say it opens at 10; my kids arrived at 10, only to have to wait till 11 for the ogo balls to even open. They had issues with the balls having holes, and then the blower broke..etc... They charge an insane amount for this 2 seconds zip flyer. Save your money and go to a 2-3 hour zip flyer trip which is the same price. 30 bucks a person for a 1 second zip flyer is insane. We were told we received a ""free"" upgrade but the next morning when I got my bill, our rate had gone up 50.00.

We had a beautiful room and enjoyed the sunsets over the golf course and the woods everyday. My daughter loved the indoor pool! The maze and climbing wall was a great hit with her as well (she is 5) and we enjoyed the zip line a lot.   We didn't get a chance to walk a lot of the trails but from what I saw they were great as well.  The pillows in our room were quite hard so the nights were a bit short. The cleaning staff was incredibly friendly which I had never experienced anywhere else!   All in all a wonderful stay at this resort, we will go back for sure.

The staff was helpful, friendly and exceptionally caring. Our vacation purpose was a family getaway for a few days. My sons are 13, and had SO much fun with ogoing, swimming, hiking, and downhill mountain biking. I just cant say enough about the guys who took my son mountain biking. He had never been and I was nervous about his safety. These guys took him up the hill and rode with him, as he learned. All the while, the ones at the bottom where I waited, offered very kind reassurance of his safety.   Our room was not one of the updated ones, but still, it was clean and VERY comfortable. We enjoyed the pool at various times throughout the day each and every day. The treetop trekking was the coolest thing that I've ever seen, and my kids LOVED it. The buffet breakfast at the Crazy Horse was expansive to say the least. Everything imaginable on it. I bugged the front desk at least once a day for xtra coffee packets, and they were ALWAYS kind and sweet, regardless of our needs. This is definitely a place that I plan to call a getaway home.",5,positive

We really enjoyed our stay and the amenities (pools, adventure park). Food at Crazy Horse was good and priced reasonably. Service was excellent - when checking out, the individual who was assisting me left to ask a question and no less than 3 employees walking by asked if I was being helped. Kids have asked when/if we can go back. Would consider renting a condo if staying longer and if available.",4,positive

Please note we were staying nearby and only wanted to make use of the restaurant. We were going to go to Silks the finer dining establishment but it was not open. Thank goodness.   We had a fair to medium quality meal at the Crazy Horse but when presented with the bill found that a 3% Resort Amenity Fee had been added to our bill. We explained that we were not quests of the resort and only dropped in to the restaurant. We asked to see where on the menu this charge was indictated or where on the doors to the premise there was a notice posted. The manager acknowledged that none of these ""warnings"" existed but she still refused to remove the illegal tax from our bill. When we told her it would either be removed from the bill or from the servers tip she told us that we one of her best servers and that would be unfortuneate but she could not remove it from the bill. Guess that shows how much she valued her employee.  Apparently this applies to everything at the resort. Make sure you are getting a great deal on the room because with the hidden tax added back in it may not seem so great. Oh and for you foreign guests they charge our 13% Ontarion Harmoized sales tax on top to the 3% so the extra gouge is more like 3.39%.  From the other comments here it looks like the promise to put this back into the resort is an empty promise.",1,negative

We spent a lot of time in the swimming pool and hot tub too. We used their grills by the pool several times to cook out. The kids loved the game room. There is also an indoor pool and hot tub as well as a spa in the Inn portion of the resort. Housekeeping was quick to help us when we had trouble setting up the Wii that we brought and the DVD.

116088233,barrie/ca/154980/185603/116088233.html,Horseshoe Resort,"The Adventure Park is such a mediocre operation. My peeves with the place is that when issues arise, the staff just brushed off our concerns. They also do not seem to be very knowledgable about the park, thus, preventing the guests from fully experiencing the joys of the park.   Example 1 - No map. Staff response: oh we don't have any more maps and continued doing whatever she was doing.   Example 2 - Was told by staff that the park opens at 11am on Saturday, but in fact the park opens at 10am. As a result, we can only book the zip line near the end of the day and missed the opportunity to try it for a second time due to the lack of availabliity.   Example 3 - Waited an hour and forty minutes for the dry Ogo ride. The staff knew there was a higher demand for dry ride vs. the wet one, but refused to prioritize the one in demand. I also have a big issue with the communication of regarding the logistics of getting to the ride. I felt clueless on what to do e.g. no signage to say what can be taken with us and getting my feet totally wet when I got off the ride, when I'm expecting to be on a dry ride. Since I did not expect to have to take off my shoes for ride (can't find it on the website, don't have brochures available at the park), step into puddles of water on a dry sunny day, I had to walk around all day in damp socks and waiting forever to complete the ride.   To cap it all off, we had a pay a ""Resort Improvement Fee"" (was called a ""Resort Amenities Fee"" from another member) when eating at the resort restaurant. Since we really don't plan to go back, we could really care less about improvements in the future.",1,negative

Our room was stunning - great view to watch the golfers!!!   Just by way of constructive criticism (although we did stay during a heatwave!!) we found the air conditioning a little below power for our comfort but again perhaps this was an exceptional circumstance.

Booked our trip via Travelzoo which offered a good rate for a basic room which included a lovely buffet breakfast each morning. When we booked, we upgraded to a Parlour Suite which consisted of two queen beds, a fireplace, a jetted whirlpool tub and sunken living area. We also added golf. We still felt that it was a very good rate.  There was some confusion as to exactly how many rounds of golf were included in our package and it actually took a couple of calls to the resort to straighten it out, but once we sorted it out, everything worked out well.  The room was very clean and had a nice view of the 18th hole. The TV was old and the reception was terrible. Our remote wasn't working but that was fixed with a phone call to the front desk. The beds were comfortable but the pillows were terrible. So bad that we had to make a trip to Walmart to get pillows!! The A/C really struggled to keep the room cool and was very noisy. Definitely things that need to be addressed.  While at the resort, we used both the indoor and outdoor pools and the whirlpool. They were all very nice and clean and refreshing. There is an ""adventure park"" which we did not use, but thought it was a good idea if you had children to entertain. The a la carte prices seemed a bit high but there was an all-day pass which looked reasonable.   Golf on the Valley Course on both Saturday and Sunday was very good. We enjoyed the beautiful scenery and thought the course was very well maintained. Would definitely play there again.  We ate dinner at the Crazy Horse Restaurant the first night. When we arrived around 8pm, the wait staff were a bit flustered and struggled to find us a table. A very loud kid's baseball team and their parents arrived for dinner unexpectedly and the staff were unprepared for this onslaught. It didn't help that the parents sat away from the children, therefore there was mayhem!! Not the staff's fault of course, but it made for an uncomfortable and rushed dinner. To make matters worse, we were very disappointed with our dinner. We found the prices to be a very high for the quality of the meal. We had planned on eating at the resort both nights but decided to forego the restaurants on Saturday night and go into Barrie to find a nice place to eat. We considered trying Silks but were afraid to be disappointed again.  Overall, we had a very nice time at the Horseshoe Valley Resort and would definitely go again for the right price. All the staff we encountered were exceptional and the resort was kept very clean!! The issues with the rooms and food can definitely be corrected and Horseshoe has the ability to be a top notched year around resort.",3,negative

The rooms were clean and a decent size and the showers were great. The air conditioning unit was definitely too loud and the beds a little too soft for our liking. If ever we come again, we would bring our own pillows as these ones were HUGE and unbelievably puffy it is all about personal preference...I love flat pillows). Crazy Horse restaurant was surprisingly good, and the prices were reasonable. The wait staff was very attentive and interested in providing good service. We went to the Adventure Park and had a blast. The wait for the OGO ball was long as there was only one track open for operation. We were warned of this, so no unfortunate surprises! My only complaint was that the outdoor pool was not available one morning/afternoon because of expected rain and thunder (the sign on the door). However the sun was out and there were a lot of guests who wanted to use the facilities. The indoor pool was open, but we chose the hotel based on the outdoor pool. The story changed after several complaints from others...we were told that there was actually a chemical problem with the pool....I am not sure if this was due to the rain that fell the night before, but it really shouldn't have had any impact. We were told to return by 4pm that maybe the pool would be ready by then (it was!) We did not let this ruin our trip and instead did some exploring in the morning and early afternoon around the grounds and the woods that surround the hotel.

We booked online and were assured that everything was working when I called the day before. We arrived shortly after opening to be told we had to wait in line for a wristband. They were so slow it took 40 minutes to be seen. That after a 2 hour journey. By that time it was 11 and they had already run out of maps of the place. Then we are told the zip flyer and OGO were not working and as we had an all day pass they offered the euro bungy instead (not the mountain biking or anything decent). If you are older than 8 the euro bungy does not cut it. The line for the food was incredibly slow and only one person serving and it was overpriced and salty and so bad we had to chuck most of it away. It was not even that busy yet everything seemed so long. We probably spent 3/4 of our day in the park waiting. Some of the staff were miserable and others not that articulate. Overall a it of a waste of time and well overpriced for what you get. They have a similar style of summer park in Tremblant and it beats this place hands down.,2,negative

We enjoyed the vacation and I would like to update previous reviews with our experience.  The Horseshoe Adventure Park has some changes from last year. They added a maze for children to the Adventure Park and, at least in July, did not have the summer tubing set up. The “zorbing” is now called Ogo, using the same equipment. We did the Treetop Trekking at Horseshoe and played a round of golf on the Valley course. Both were enjoyed by the entire family.  Horseshoe Resort has hotel rooms at the Inn and 2 bedroom 2 bath apartments at the Lodges. The Lodges units were large and clean, but are in need of general updating. Our unit had wallpaper peeling in places and a generally outdated look and feel. Horseshoe is no longer conducting mid-week cleanings at the Lodges. Also, there were several families from the surrounding area using the Lodges swimming pool as day trippers, making the pool busy on weekends. The pool at the Lodges is one of the best lifeguarded pools I have seen at any resort. It's really a safe place for kids.  Overall, we really enjoyed our stay and just wish the Lodges units were updated to modern standards.",3,negative

After the hour and a half drive from Toronto, we got there and headed to the ticket stand where they had taped to the glass a bunch of papers saying things like ""OGO is not functioning today - sorry for inconvenience"", ""zip line is fully booked for the day - sorry for inconvenience"", ""tree top trekking is not part of the adventure package - fully booked for the weekend"".  Keep in mind we arrived there at noon on a Saturday, a long weekend Saturday to be exact.  So what was available on that day:  -water OGO -rock climbing -mini golf -maze  Of all these things, the only one that was any real fun was the water OGO, which I wouldn't mind doing again. But even that lasted only a couple of seconds and we had waited in line for almost 45 minutes.  The were operating 2 lanes for the water OGO and the 3rd one was closed because they were understaffed that day! On a long-weekend Saturday!  In all, we probably spent a hour total doing stuff and then we were done and about to leave.   I would definitely not want to go back there or recommend it to anyone - the ""adventure park"" was a major disappointment.  If you have children they would probably enjoy it, but then again you would be able to find more fun activities for them closer to the GTA and you wouldn't need to drive almost two hours out to Barrie and pay a premium for it!",1,negative

Found out that they are planning on expanding in the future which will be great. We used to go to a resort in the States that offered this kind of outdoor adventure park and outdoor activities but I hated driving seven hours to get there. This resort was way more convenient. Only thing I would suggest was more shade and seating areas for resting as well as better pool facilities or a future waterpark/splashpad feature. Otherwise an amazing time.

The resort address is right. 1101 Horseshoe valley rd, so make sure you look up the address as the resort is east of the 400, not on Penetanguishene Rd. I stayed at the resort for a work conference early October 2011. The rooms were above average and had all the amenities. We had to go outside to cross over to the crazy horse restaurant for breakfast and lunch as well as to attend our conference. The crazyhorse buffet breakfast was $13.95 for the usual stuff that was only a bit more than you get free at other hotels. The pre-formed frozen pancake i had one morning was so hard i could not eat it!   The restaurant in the actual hotel was only open for dinner, but we decided to drive the 20 minutes into Barrie rather than risk it.   The actual conference room was long and narrow, so those at the back had a hard time seeing and hearing at times.   Overall it was ok, and i'm sure that if you go there to golf, ski etc that its a lot of fun.

119086683,barrie/ca/154980/185603/119086683.html,Horseshoe Resort,We purchase a family set of tickets for the Adventure park for my son's 12th birthday. After looking at the activities on the internet he was extremely excited to enjoy his birthday gift. Upon arrival at the park at opening time we began our day with over a hour wait to get checked in (snails pass line up - isappointment number 1). While in line a park employee made his way through the line informing customers that the zip line was fullly booked and would not be available to any additional customers (disappointment number 2).   Following completion of our check in we proceeded to the UGO ball which my son was looking  forward to. We were informed that the wait would be around 3 hours - keep in mind that this was first thing in the morning. My son and husband headed up to the ride willing to put in their time for an enjoyable ride. While I was waiting at the bottom for them to come down I was engaged in a conversation with other customers that had expressed their disappointment with the lack of events being available and the time that it took to enjoy the rides. We both were  disguisted with the work ethic of the employees - the four employees at the bottom of the hill did not attempt in any manner appeared concerned with the efficiency of opperation of the ride. It took anywhere between 10 to 20 minutes between ride for the balls to be moved of the hill and another ride to come down the hill. The pulley system that carried the rides to the top were often empty and the balls were not returned to the top of the hill in a manner that would enable for the customers at the top would be able to proceed through the ride at an acceptable manner. After about 3 hours of waiting my son and husband came down the hill without taking the ride. They both stated that they were so frustrated at the poor service of the staff at the top that they decided to not wait any longer - they were told while in line at the top that it would take 4 hours in the line to get to the ride. That was not bad enough but they also appeared to have no concern for the customers and spent no effort to have the ball prepared with people in them and ready to go when the bottom ball was removed and clear to go (that wait was longer than neccessary - disappointment number 3).  The next thing that we went to was the mini putt - which also had a hour wait.  My son also tried out the wall climbing - which he did enjoy.  Overall I found our experience terrible - my son had a big let down with his birthday gift. After being so excited that he had talked to his friends and family about his birthday gift for weeks - he turned around and said that he did not want a gift like that again - it was a ripoff. He only got to enjoy the mini putt and wall climbing - not worth the money even at a deal price!!!!!,1,negative

We booked the Play All Day package in a Premier room which I thought was good value for the money.  We arrived early at 10:30 and was happy to discover that our room was ready for us. We had the room furthest from the elevators (344), with a nice view overlooking the golf course.  Parking was difficult to find close to the Inn, but I imagine that it was only a problem b/c it was a busy long weekend. We parked near the Lodge and had a short walk over to the Inn.  Front desk staff and housekeeping were very friendly and helpful. I found that staff in the gift shop / pool sign-in were not as friendly.  There was a wait for elevators and only 1 out of the 2 were working. We usually took the stairs down.  The grounds were very well maintained. We enjoyed the indoor and outdoor pool and the hot tub. The (woman’s) change rooms were spacious and clean.  Our package included passes to the adventure park. I was very happy to be able to pre-book a time for the zip flyer. However, I felt there could have been better communication between the front desk and the adventure park. I also wished the front desk gave me more information about my package at check-in. They didn’t let me know what was included in the pass. I was happy to find that our passes were good for both check-in and check-out days, but I wished I had that information beforehand so I could have made better scheduling choices.   The park was fun. Park staff were friendly and helpful. I saw improvements from when we were there last year. The zip flyer is the best thing at the park. It was a busy long weekend and so there were queues for most attractions. The Euro-Bungee was closed. There must be a better system for the Ogo. I would have liked to see a time posted at the bottom of the hill. We left our shoes and things at the bottom and proceeded to the top. After waiting 45 minutes and not getting near the front of the line we decided to bail and go back another time. We had to walk down a long rocky path to get back to our shoes. That was not fun. We went back to the Ogo’s an hour before the park closed to a shorter queue.   We ate at Crazy Horse for lunch. The service was great but the food was just okay. I thought the prices were reasonable for resort dining.   We ate a quick dinner at the Hitching Post in the Adventure Park. It was convenient.  Our package included breakfast at Crazy Horse. They served a buffet with many hot items and fresh fruit. We enjoyed the food. Service was also very good.  I would go back to this resort and would definitely recommend others to go.

We decided to come to Horseshoe Valley to celebrate our 1 year wedding anniversary. We were going to do the play all day adventure pass, and staying at the resort overnight. We were doing the adventure park, as friends of ours had recommended it to us. From the moment we got there, things went downhill. We arrived at the park at approximately 10:20 am, and were in the lineup at 10:30 am. A woman a couple of people ahead of us, mentioned at that point that the ziplining was already booked up until 5pm that day. With approximately 75 people ahead of us in line, our expectations of getting onto the zipliner were diminishing. A few minutes later, a gentleman confirmed what we thought to be true. He informed us that the zipliner was completely sold out for the entire day. We were quite disappointed as that was our hoped highlight of the day. We decided to try and make the best of it, and attempt to do the other activities. The Euro Bungy apparatus was not functioning that day, so that was out of the equation also. A short while later, we attempted to do the OGO attraction. After removing socks and shoes, and going uphill to wait, we were informed that there was a 3 hour wait to do the OGO. Again, at that point we were pretty discouraged at paying for an all day pass, that seemed to consist of only a couple of events. The mini golf was completely jammed at several points during the day, no doubt because of the ziplining being sold out, the euro bungy being non operational and the ridiculous wait time for the OGO. In short, we paid a lot of money to drive over 2 hours, to do the rock climbing. All of which took a meager 10 minutes.  If we did not have a hotel room booked, and lost the money from that, we would have driven home. My husband attempted to check into the hotel at 3:30, but we were informed we had to wait until 4pm. When we finally checked into our hotel room, we were quite surprised at the room. The room was certainly not worth the money either. Upon entering the room, there was a huge stain in the carpet in front of the table, the carpet on the stairs was ripping off, there were all kinds of paint stains in the railing on the stairs, the wallpaper was ripping off the walls in several places, the bathroom tiles and countertop was outdated, there were cobwebs in the lights, scuffs in the walls, and several flies in the large window as well as a couple of dead flies in our powder room. We had dinner at the Crazy Horse restaurant, and the prices at this place were outrageous! We had some fries, and fish and chips that totalled almost $30!!! We weren't eating steak!! After dinner, we went back to our room to watch the Leafs game on television. After several attempts of trying to find it, we discovered that several tv channels were not working. Those being channels 4, 5, 10, 11, 12, 23, 33, 57. Other channels had snow on them, those being channels 39 and 40. We called for maintenance at approximately 7:10 pm and at 7:55 no one had shown up yet, so we had to make another call to get someone up to the room. The maintenance guy came after an hour to inform us that approximately 5 channels didn't work due to a satellite being down. What a joke, considering some of the channels were toronto stations. We used the whirlpool tub and the drain/plug would not drain properly. The water was sitting in the tub after use for approximately 45 minutes. We had to literally pull the plug as hard as possible so that the water would drain out of the tub. The remote for the bedroom tv didn't work at all. So, not only did we not have the channels mentioned above, but we had to get out of bed to change channels, volume and turn off the tv. In the morning, we turned on the fireplace to warm up the room a little bit. When we lowered the front screen to push the button, the whole front door fell off the fireplace. After we showered, we were quite happy to leave the resort. We are completely dissatisfied with the adventure park, and the hotel as well. We feel we were cheated out of our 1st year wedding anniversary and we would like a response to this as soon as possible. We would like our money refunded for the room, and the adventure park, as we are not interested in returning again. If we cannot get any satisfation for all of the problems we encountered, we will make a note of putting this on Trip Advisor so the general public knows what to expect before they spend a lot of money for a lot of disappointment.",1,negative
119300920,barrie/ca/154980/185603/119300920.html,Horseshoe Resort,"My husband and I stayed in one of the “premium” suites at the Inn - for a romantic getaway to celebrate a milestone birthday. We booked this room ""upgrade"" primarily for the fireplace and the extra-large Jacuzzi. To say that we were “underwhelmed” is an understatement; we were borderline disgusted with the quality/condition of the room.   The room itself was VERY poorly maintained, dirty and outdated (circa 1980's). When we arrived in the room, the walls were dirty, scuffed and had something that looked like food splashed on it. The casing around the closet door was pulling right off the frame. The bathroom was by far the worst – our sink had multiple cracks in it, the faucets functioned poorly, the Jacuzzi tub was stained and grey/brown on the bottom (we didn't even use it because of this), and there were missing and cracked floor tiles with dirty/stained grout. Our disappointment didn't end there. My husband and I decided to have wine in front of the (VERY old electric) fireplace, but the chairs in the sitting area were so stained and dirty, we didn’t even want to sit in them.  We had also booked online to combine our stay with the Treetop Trekking adventure (which we were very excited about). Two days before our stay, I called to check when our time was for the start of the Trekking. We were advised that they did not have our reservation and, when we explained that we had booked our package online, the staff member said that their e-mail hadn't been working properly and that we should have called instead. From a business perspective, if you know that something isn't working properly and that it affects the quality of customer service, don't you get it fixed??  Hotel and restaurant staff were friendly, though, and the food at Sillks was very good. We had breakfast at Crazyhorse, where the food was mediocre at best. When I shared my complaints about our room with management at the Inn, they advised that they would offer us a ""special"" rate the next time that we stayed there. Since we have no intention on spending any other money at this poorly-maintained ""resort"", this was no consolation and, in our opinion, very poor business. We were also told that they had refurbished some of the rooms in the Inn. I'm not sure which rooms these were, but my hope would have been that they might have started with some updates to the rooms that were the MORE expensive to stay in?  My advice ... if you have a burning desire to see Horseshoe Valley, book some activities (by phone!) at the Adventure Park or go out for dinner there. Don't waste your money on the Inn!",1,negative

(max 6 people per condo) This is a skiing resort and for that reason, we are staying at the resort for one whole week. After a long day of skiing and skateboarding, we could come back to enjoy hot shower immediately. The resort is separated into hotel rooms and condo building, but they are close to each other for sharing the common amenities such as activity room and pool. Our condo is with full kitchen equiped that we brought our own food to cook during our stay. We had instant noodles for snack, steak for dinner and pizza for night snacks. The resort offers many restaurants for skiiers or hotel guests but pricey. We did save a lot of meal money and had a blast with our own food. Oeverall, the resort is a bit aged, but we did manage to get through the week with comfort. We will try a different resort at Blue mountain in the next vacation.",3,negative

When explaining my situation to the staff, they were more than willing to do what they could to help fix it. After all that was said and done the weekend couldn't have been made better. The staff was always extremely helpful and friendly whenever I needed a question answered or had a request. The facilities are well kept, well staffed, and very pleasant. I would definitely recommend Horseshoe to anyone looking for a nice weekend away.  I did the treetop trekking but also rode the bicycle trails there and had a blast. The adventure park looks like a ton of fun and will definitely return to try the other activities offered by Horseshoe.  The rooms are very well kept, beds clean and comfortable, and the view is spectacular. I wouldn't miss a chance to visit Horseshoe and experience all they have to offer. Can't do it all in one weekend so you'll have to go a few times, not like that would be a bother.",5,positive

After reading a few negative comments on TripAdvisor, I must admit I was quite circumspect and skeptic about our stay. Needless to say, we did not experience any problems at all, quite the opposite. We stayed in one of the renovated rooms with a great view of the golf course, spacious and inviting. Everything was new and spotless. The walk-in rain shower, the LHD TV, coffee maker, furniture were all in excellent condition. Both lunches and dinners at the CrazyHorse were such a treat. I warmly recommend the place to all visitors. Compliments to the Chef! Good food and friendly atmosphere, what else can one wish for? We relaxed in the pool, sauna and whirlpool as much as we could, before and after hiking, played squash and used the gym. I wish we could have tried the Maze and the Mini Golf as well but the Park was sadly, closed. All in all, we had a fabulous time at the resort and will come again. I also like that it is quite affordable for small families such as ours, for people who are not too sportsy or highly adventurous.",5,positive

It is a great place to stay with children for a quiet retreat. I would recommend it, but do ask for a renovated room if you are used to a nice hotel feel. Also, the snack machines on site are extremely expensive, so if you are traveling with children, bring your own snacks. The breakfast is nice and the hiking trails and scenery are fabulous.

120552668,barrie/ca/154980/185603/120552668.html,Horseshoe Resort,"I suppose this review could be called a comedy of errors, but we aren't laughing.  My girlfriend bought me a Lifestyle Giftcard stay at this resort, which included a one night stay, in a premium room with a fireplace, a bottle of wine, a 3-course dinner and breakfast.  So we arrived and the girl at the front desk checked us in quickly and told us our room was ready. We asked if we could have dinner anytime or if we needed to make reservations and she said we were fine to go down to the restaurant Silks anytime. She also told us that there was a Young person Leadership convention at the resort all weekend, so there were like 200 kids grades 7-10 there. Great. Just our luck right?  Well, we went to our room. Now I have seen the management has made comments on the neg reviews here and said that out of the 100 rooms there are 27 newly renovated rooms with flatscreen tv's and the like. Well, apparently the kids must have gotten those, cause our room was DATED, with stains on the carpet, the fireplace only sort of worked and the front grate was damned near falling off. The heat it provided was a JOKE, unless you were in the square foot of space directly in front of the heating grate it proved NO HEAT. The bathroom was rough...tiles broken, the wallpaper was actually PEELING off the wall (don't think I've seen that in anywhere except a motel) and the ""jacuzzi"" or ""hot tub"" or whatever...sketchy. Neither of us wanted to bother using it for fear of what sort of random bacteria was crawling in the ring and grit on the bottom of it. The TV (and old CRT from the 1990's) had MAYBE 15 channels, and a bunch of snow and fuzz. Is this the 1980's? Come on Horseshoe, satellite tv exists now.  Anyway, we put our stuff down and were hungry at around 3PM so we went downstairs for a bite to eat. Well it turns out they are renovating the pub style place (the Crazy Horse) on site so we were told that Silks has the menu for Crazy Horse. We went down and the girl seated us in the mostly empty restaurant and gave us menus. Then she came back to tell us that we had to move. So this dude who worked there told us that a wedding party had bought out the entire restaurant...you get that? the whole restaurant. We just wanted lunch. So where did they think was a good place to move us? The Lobby. I don't mean at the side of the lobby, I meant they put a table and two chairs BY ITSELF in the middle of the lobby (in view of the front desk! Come on!). We got up after sitting for a moment with the intent on going into Barrie to eat lunch. Now at this point the manager of SIlks (who had only just arrived and was a little stunned as to what was happening) asked us if we were leaving and we said yes and he was very apologetic and offered to have food and drinks delivered to our room. He also informed us that we needed reservations for our special dinner (Thanks front desk girl for not telling us!). And of course by that point the only time left was 8:30PM!  Lunch was nice in our room, and when we went down for dinner MUCH later the nice manager gave us the best seat in the house...where his staff promptly ignored us for 10-15 minutes! Seriously, some people were seated at the next table ten minutes after us and were given fresh water and bread...and we sat with nothing, and no one had even come up to say word 1 to us yet. Eventually we hailed down another waitress (not from our area) who took our order and then FINALLY our proper waitress came over, and began to serve us. Now the dinner at Silks was the ONLY part of our stay we enjoyed. The dinner was delicious and well worth the time...if only our night would continue on such a good path.  Enter the ""leadership"" conference kids. I put leadership in quotes because loud, misbehaving kids slamming doors, running up and down hallways, knocking on our door, leaving trash outside our door, and doing makeshift kung-fu in the hallway and shouting at eat other at 11PM did NOT make for a pleasant stay. Note to Hotel: If you are havign THAT many kids stay, job #1 is to NOTIFY GUESTS OF THIS BEFORE THEY BOOK and Job# 2: Make sure the chaperones of those kids KEEP THEM IN LINE. When my girlfriend and I are attempting to have a romantic getaway and there are screaming kids outside the door, that's a bit of a damper on the mood.  Breakfast was standard, even thought we both had poached eggs...which were not properly poached and may as well have been called hard-boiled eggs made to resemble poached.  It didn't matter, we really just couldn't wait to leave.   I don't like to complain about places I stay and I really try to give them the benefit of the doubt, and I even went into this place having read all the negative reviews and set my expectations low, but this place was just a mess of horrible management.   The only guy making ANYTHING work there is the manager at the restaurant who was very accommodating (even if his wait staff were really phoning it in) to us. But like I said, aside from the meal at Silks in the evening, I would not wish this place as a getaway for anyone with a lick of sense. The negative reviews are correct, this place is NOT worth it, and most especially for the price we paid, we were REALLY disappointed.

I read the response from management to the unsatisfied customer I mentioned previously, and they stated that they have renovated 27 rooms of a 100.

We arrived at the resort, very late in the evening mind you, to find that the trekking was not open, even though they had signs posted that they were open all year. We notified one of the managers, at the resort of our misfortune. She was positively the best person that I have ever seen take responsiblity of what occured and took immediate steps to compensate us for the inconvience. The room we stayed in was immaculant with a wonderfully beautiful view. We ate at the restaurant on-site and it was amazing. We were a little nervouse that the restaurant would be closed, but yet again, the manager called us to find out when we would be down, and kept the restaurant open so that we would be able to have a romantic dinner. I have been at different hotels and resorts, and I have to say that if there was a manager at every hotel, like the manager we were fortunate enough to encouter here, then there wouldn't be any disgruntled patrons/customers/clientele or whatever we are to be called.

Everything from starters and salads to entrees and desserts was so wonderfully prepared that you would take a mouthful and wonder at just how somebody would think combine these particular tastes and textures to create such a culinary delight.

We stayed in the newly renovated rooms, which were clean with two comfortable beds and the pillows were great. TV reception wasn't great, but we weren't there to watch tv and they have the weather channel, pbs, history and discovery channels, which were what we like. The fridge was a good size and the bathroom clean and functional, however, the shower took literally ten minutes before we got warm water. I am not sure why this was, but after the first shower we learned to turn it on before getting undressed. The pool, hot tub and suana were very nice. The hill was a short walk and the restaurants were all within walking range. I took skiing lessons with a guy named Chewy, who was excellent. We only ate in the chalet cafeteria, but it was good enough and not too expensive. My kids loved the hot Beavertails and want to go back just for them. We will definately go back.

I wasted $450 on a weekend to this run down, over-priced resort.  We chose a higher end room for our 6th wedding anniversary, one where we could cuddle up to a fireplace. That would have been nice if the fireplace actually worked well. On high, it barely put out any heat at all. It made so much noise at night that it kept me awake with the constant humming and buzz. So much cold radiated from the windows, even the curtains moved when the wind was blowing. There were 6 watchable TV stations on a television from the 90's. The bathroom was a nightmare, the TINIEST shower I could barely fit in and I'm a thin guy but even worse, the smell was disgusting and it dripped all freaking night. The heating system was incredibly LOUD, every time it kicked in I nearly jumped out of my bed at night.  Breakfast at Silks wasn't the best, either. Mediocre food and very poor service. We sat at our table for 15 minute before anyone even came by.   Last, when we were checking out, we mentioned all the problems and the gentleman at the front desk was SO condescending.

We had a wonderful time - my son took snowboarding lessons, my daughter swam, and we all loved tubing. Room was dated but fine (although no one came to clean while we were there) and food was OK ( Crazy Horse needs a REAL salad on the menu). But - there was a ski and snowboard festival and the participants partied LOUD all night. I was woken up at 3AM and it was so loud with doors slamming, people hollering and running up and down the hallways that I called the front desk. I was told security would come by and quiet things down, but 45 minutes later it was even worse. So I called back and someone else answered and told me there was this festival and they were trying to handle the situation. By 4:30 I had almost given up hope and tried calling once more - I was informed the OPP were called, and I looked out the window and saw the police vehicles pulling up! I was shocked. But by 5 it was quiet. Really Horseshoe? Really? You had no clue that families and rowdy teens should be separate? And you had no expectation of drunken trouble at such an event? I'm exhausted.",2,negative

126056349,barrie/ca/154980/185603/126056349.html,Horseshoe Resort,"We had the best time. No complaints at all. The package we chose was lift passes for day of arrival until 10 pm the next day plus room and breakfast buffet. Under $300 for a family of 5.  Our room was as requested. Two queens and a roll up cot for the smallest child worked out superbly. The room had a lounge area with a fireplace, two cozy chairs and a desk. If I had to say something bad, it would be the TV. The signal wasn't very good and the TV was only a 32"" tube style. Could use an update there.  Only the kids used the passes so it would have been a waste had we not found someone looking for lift tix. Helped recoup some of the cost.  We all know that we didn't have the best winter for skiing this year but the snow making equipment here is top-rate. The base is 3 ft thick and there were no bare areas that I could see from the base of the hills.  We tired the kids out in the pool after boarding all day and they crashed! Breakfast buffet was delicious. There were eggs, hashbrowns, sausage and bacon, waffles, toast, bagels, cereals as well as muffins and other pastries along with all of the condiments you could want. The kids got back out on the hills right away and got in about a dozen more runs before we had to leave.  We would definitely go back!",4,positive

Check-in and check-out were quick. No long line up. Rooms were clean, nothing to complain. TV was a tube. The pool, oh we will never forget how relax it can be in the hot tub after a day of skiing.

126181797,barrie/ca/154980/185603/126181797.html,Horseshoe Resort,"We chose Horseshoe Valley for our vacation because we heard the ski slopes always had snow and the lines for the lifts weren't as bad as many other ski resorts in Ontario. The Inn is located right across from the slopes so it made sense to stay there for 2 nights.  There were many negatives about our experience at the Inn, but some positives. When you read the Inn's website, you see complimentary parking and think ""YAY!"", but upon arrival the entrance to the Inn was packed with cars lined up to unload and there was no parking in front of the Inn to check in, so we had to park a 3 min walk away, check in, then tug our bags, skis, ski boots, etc into the room (took 2 trips) - nobody will offer to help you even if you're a single parent with a young child so be prepared!  Check in - do not expect to check in before the appointed check in time! We arrived at 3:40 and were told our room was still not ready and to wander around the property until 4pm when it would be ready. Once we got our keys and went to our room, the hallways were crowded with maids carts (at 4pm??? Unusual!). Again, nobody will offer to help so, be prepared to be superstrong!  The room - the temperature was set to super-warm, the windows did not open, and the pillows were incredibly big! Impossible to sleep on, so we ended up sleeping without pillows! The extra blankets were thin and one even had a 3 cm hole in it. The fan in the vents were just so loud we turned off the temp control at night. The bathroom was ok - the towels are really small and the floor mat is also really small. The mirror in the bathroom had 2 burn marks on it. Not at all impressive. However, the bed itself was really nice and the room itself was nice, clean and spacious. Oh, the tv had only 2 channels that were not scrambled and the closed captions did not work! Food choices - When we were there there were only 3 choices to get our meals - the Crazy Horse restaruant, SILKS restaruant and the cafeteria. Crazy Horse served decent food and the wait staff were super friendly! SILKS was where we had our free breakfast - nothing impressive (your regular buffett of sausages, scrambled eggs, various pastries and bagels, cereals and breads and jams). We never had to wait for a table - which was really nice. However, we forgot to bring water and the water bottles in the cafeteria were $2.75 and in the Inn, were $3.75 - ridiculus prices, but we were so dehydrated we had to buy 2 bottles and refill them at the tap! Skiing - we had SO much fun and the lift operators were just soooo nice! Definately will return because they were all so friendly!

The dishwasher leaked water all over the floor. We had to call the front desk for more towels, a lighter to light the fire and sugar for coffee in the morning. There were no sheets left for the pullout couch. The heat was not controlled well and was very noisy. On a positive side, the kitchen was well stocked and had a large fridge.

For anyone who loves to ski however - Mount St. Louis Moonstone offers better runs but this is has a great location at the bottom of the hill.

So much that I purchased property near Horsheshoe as a year-round family cottage/chalet for skiing, golfing, and mtn.biking on the endless single tracks in the Copeland forest. It's also in close proximity to the many beaches on Georgian Bay.  While I can imagine there are many challenges in operating a four-season family resort, I have seen a severe deterioration in many areas, especially in terms of pricing and service. Pricing for everything has skyrocketed since 2009; the buildings and rooms are in dire straits--so bad that I do not recommend any friends/relatives to stay in the resort; and the service has gone downhill (no pun intended) although the service at the Crazy Horse pub is OK. Far too many issues to state, but I am hoping that the new Resort owners can turn it into a first-class family-friendly destination.",4,positive

It was by far one of the best resorts in Ontario that I have ever stayed at. Upon arrival, all of the staff were very welcoming, knowledgeable and approachable. They were able to answer all the questions I had.  Among all the fantastic staff that I met while staying at the resort, I had the pleasure of meeting both the GM and Assistant GM of the resort. It’s not often that you meet people who truly love their job, but you can just tell within minutes these gentlemen love their job. They made me and my fellow coworkers feel truly welcomed and appreciated.  Not only are the staff a great reason to stay at the resort, but the food is fantastic! If I had to only recommend one item on the menu, I would say that you have to try Crazy Horse’s ribs! They are to die for! But all of the items on the menu are extremely good. You also have to try the Sticky Toffee Pudding! Nothing will ever compare to Fay’s delicious creations. All of her deserts are so delicious. They are worth the calories!   The spa is also something you must see when you go to the resort. The ladies are so nice and friendly. I felt immediately relaxed after a long day of meetings.

The bathroom had a small sink and the faucet didn't have a simple washer so water splashed all over.

Flashback.... when we booked our vacation getaway here we pictured a quiet weekend at a decent hotel in the middle of nature far from the city. What we got the first night was something akin to trying to fall asleep in a crowded bar with a bad wedding crooner. Yes reliving the scenes from the movie Dirty Dancing with "" I had the time of my life "" and doing the "" Macarena "" at 12 am wasn't what we had in mind for relaxation especially after a long day of hiking.   Upon complaining to the front desk the manager on duty she told me that they would ask them to turn the music down at 11 but they had the tent until 1 am. This would be like asking someone to slam a revolving door, I said. ( note: I don't think the manager understood the analogy ) There was no offer of giving us another room away from the noise and no apology offered. I was told maybe I could join the wedding party. Not funny.   1 am came and went and the music was finally turned off. However when you have 200 drunk wedding guests the noise doesn't just end. It wasn't until 1:30 am that things began to quieten down.   Things didn't just end there. After another day of hiking and relaxing ( trying ) we got back to our room around 2:30 pm and wanted to have a nap. Funny I thought... is someone hammering upstairs? or next door? Wait for it.... upon calling the front desk I was told that the upstairs of the hotel was under construction and that there would be noise going on all day.  She told me maybe I should go take a hike ( literally ). Really I thought? Again no offer of moving us to another room and no apology. By this time we were ready to pack up and leave but ended just toughing it out and leaving the room for another few hours.   My questions to the resort: What kind of place labelling itself as a "" resort "" holds weddings in a tent outside 50 meters away 20-30 rooms?   Why would a resort have construction going on, on a long weekend ?   Why is your front desk staff like something out a Steven King novel?    John   Toronto Canada

Black marks on walls, furniture with gouges out of it, stained furniture, and cracked tiles. We were on the pump it up package but unfortunately the front staff did not know how to administer the $50.00 gas coupon or meal voucher. The front desk is very nice and accommodated our concerns. We looked at two other rooms and picked the two bedroom condo across from main hotel. 60's here I come! I read other reviews and understand there is reno's under way but stop charging the higher fees for under par rooms. The resort fee on top of the room tax is just a money grab and is also charged on the meals. The crazy horse salon needs major upgrading. The food was typical pub fare but very limited and overpriced. The ribs has a nice flavor but were so chewy I had to stop eating them. The pizza was good and the waitress was very pleasant.

Not a good sign of things to come. Our key in the door to our two bedroom suite was inserted and we were greeted by a horrendous stench of either the residue of an extermination or perhaps a cleaning product? Although what kind of cleaning product leaves a smell so powerful we all developed headaches in a short time. Also, if it was a cleaning product one would think the room would be clean! Pubic hairs in one bathroom, a lump of nose snot on the wall, dirty dishes, old linens with holes in them and not a hair dryer in site. There was of course two towels and two towels only in the bathrooms. Ours were two feet from the toilet so when one flushed the toilet you knew what was spraying invisibly onto your towels unless you closed the seat. This would only be palatable if one used a latex glove. Everything seemed old, tired and dirty. The room is very dated; the cabinetry scratchted, peeling and not very useful. There is lots of storage space but who wanted to unpack with the smell in the room leaching into everything. The breakfast was awful; fruit had gone bad, eggs had congealed into a hard lump and the jams which were served in huge vats were old looking and unappetizing. The rooms are thin and you can hear the neighbours. One cannot imagine why so many of the rooms were taken that weekend. Proms and weddings were happening and we shudder to think of anyone spending a honeymoon night in that awful bed with the awful lines, mattress and the gross duvet cover. What was that fabric? Suede? I dunno but it was not touching our bodies and we wore our sox to bed lest we had to put our bare feet on the stained smelly carpeting. This hotel is done! It needs millions of dollers spent on updating everything and cleaning it from top to bottom. The only good thing is that they let us out of our second night and did not charge us for it.

131519355,barrie/ca/154980/185603/131519355.html,Horseshoe Resort,"So I will begin by saying we stayed at Horseshoe for a wedding and my husband and I are people who love to travel off the beaten path so normally stay in small rustic places. The hotel was in the midst of renovations so some areas you couldn't go, but nowhere we wanted to go anyways. Our room was originally on the second floor where we would have to use the stairs (due to the renovations we couldn't use the elevator). As my mother was staying with us, when we saw the stairs we knew it wasn't going to work for her. Just then one of the Housekeeping staff was walking by and asked if she could help us with our bags up the stairs. We explained the difficulty and she promptly went to the front desk and got us a room on the main floor. Our room was quite lovely, large and comfortable. The staff throughout the resort were great and seemed genuinely happy to be at work and interacting with the guests. The wedding dinner and dance were held in a building away from all the rooms which was great for the guests who were in their rooms. Security arrived quickly to the lobby of the wedding reception to offer rides to the older people who needed a ride to the building with the rooms.  Dinner at the wedding was great. We had four choices and everyone I spoke with were really happy with the quality of their food. As well, there were an abundance of serving staff. In the morning we had the breakfast buffet which was fresh, well cooked and very tasty.  The only issue I would like to speak of was three of us reserved our rooms through www.hotel.com and for some reason the front desk had our reservation, but did not have anything saying we had already paid. Make sure if you reserve through another source, other than directly through Horseshoe, that you bring your paper work proving you have already paid.",4,positive

Upon arrival, we were greeted by one of the staff as the children were spending the day outside for ""Survivor Day"" (which was greatly organized). Some rooms were only ready at 4pm and a few others weren't ready until after 4pm... When arriving to our room, there was nothing wrong with it. We had a new rennovated room which was absolutely beautiful (on the third floor). Others who stayed on the first floor, didn't have much to say about their room. Power was out for four hours in +40 degree weather... our dinner plans had to change due to no power, so they bbq'd for the kids and we received our dinner as our lunch the following day. There was no ice machine available on the second floor as stated.. which was a disspaointment, but not the end of the world. They had ice cold water in the lobby for everyone. The staff accomodated us as much as they could...gave us water bottles at no charge to keep cool... there was no access to the indoor pool (because of the power), out door pool wasn't ready, but the kids were able to use another outdoor pool located just across the resort. I found the pool very dirty.. wasn't cleaned properly, but the kids didn't mind... later on the kids had a camp fire.  The next day, we had breakfast and enjoyed Treetop Trekking... WHAT AN EXPERIENCE! I had such a great time, the staff did an amazing job with the kids. I highly recommend it. Lunch was served afterwards then it was mini golf and Hummer tours. The tour guide was great and again, had a blast. I was also able to spend time in the Spa.

We arrived early and even though our room was not ready, we were still able to use our adventure pass to start exploring. We were disappointed the zipline was down (that should be mentioned while making the reservations) however, the front desk reception was extremely helpful and offered breakfast vouchers instead when we opted out for coming back with future passes. The breakfast buffet at Silks was an unexpected treat, gourmet style selection and my daughter appreciated the whipped cream every morning.  The condo rooms were outdated yet spacious, but most importantly clean. The rooms have so much potential, a bit more investment in renovations and this place could compete with higher star hotels. A few things like updated curtains, new paint choices and better lighting in certain rooms can go along way. The room was equipped with everything we needed (fully equipped kitchen including a microwave ) and if you bought the Jaunt special, don't forget your spices and cooking oils.The chicken was seasoned and the greek pasta salad was delicious. They were delayed a second night with the meal, but again front desk was great and gave us a discount upon departure which we were satisfied with. The kids had a blast at the adventure park which was included in the deal. Mini putt was fun, the rock climbing was a challenge for all and the trampoline was uplifting. Beware the temperature of the water in the Ogo park, I think they fill those balls with water they get from the winter ski hills.  There is a saltwater pool that the kids enoyed when we weren't in the park and if you decide to take a nature walk on the numerous trails nearby, be sure to bring bug spray. I'm not a golfer but I was told the courses were endless.  Overall it was an enjoyable holiday jaunt and I would recommend it for families looking for a close and affordable getaway from the city.",4,positive

We were greeted by a very friendly and helpful woman at reception. Our room was clean, as were all of the facilities. We purchased a package that included the room, breakfast and the adventure park. Lots to do with a 7 year old; the Ogos alone made the trip worthwhile!! We found all of the staff to be exceptional - especially the students working at the Park. They were friendly, personable and great with kids. Based on what we saw, the camp kids were well cared for and having a blast! The Lodge pool could use some updating, but was clean and they are clearly working on it. The zip line hadn't been inspected yet, so we couldn't use it, but they made up for it with passes to come back and use the whole park for a day. Overall, a great family getaway for a reasonable price.",4,positive
133708411,barrie/ca/154980/185603/133708411.html,Horseshoe Resort,"My husband and I stayed at the Horseshoe Resort from July 3 to July 7. The resort itself is rather nice, but our overall experience was disappointing. The reservation agent gave us a false rate that resulted in a much higher charge than we had been promised. To add injury to insult, the cleaning staff misappropriated an item from our room.  When I phoned to book the reservation, I was quoted a CAA rate of $116 for the first three nights and $143 for Friday night. This is a 10% reduction off the $129 and $159 normal rate according to the agent over the phone. The phone connection was not very good for some reason so I asked for the rates to be repeated. The agent stated something about a special rate for breakfast, but I did not confirm this as the connection quality was poor. We were told we would receive an email confirmation. We never received any confirmation at all. When we arrived, I was asked to show my CAA card to get the lower rate. The rates were not confirmed to me at that time. I assumed I could trust the rate that was verbally stated.  Our room was on the third floor and had been renovated recently. The beds were excellent. The shower stall was modern and without a tub. The TV was digital but there was no digital signal. The overall decor and furniture was lovely. Some of the trimming was incomplete, e.g. the door was not completely painted. The sink plug was not connected properly and could not be opened. We left water in the sink and the cleaning staff left a note on Wednesday stating that maintenance would be up to fix this problem. The next day, we did not receive any maid service at all. We asked for new towels to be brought to the room. This was done. On Friday, the cleaning staff were very attentive to our needs. We left the room at 11:30 to allow them to clean the room and returned at 4:30. The room had been cleaned properly, and the drain plug had been fixed. Unfortunately, my flat iron had been taken from the room. The manager of the cleaning staff met with us and told us that the cleaner is a 20 year employee with no complaints on record. No mention was made of the other younger woman who was also cleaning. The manager said she would have the cleaning carts searched for my flat iron and would report back to us. We never heard back and the manager on duty at check out was unaware of the issue. I cannot imagine why someone would steal a flat iron, but I also cannot imagine how a flat iron could walk away on its own. We definitely did not displace this item ourselves.  My husband checked his credit card charges and found that the hotel had over charged us on the room two days before we were scheduled to check out. I have never been billed for a room days in advance of checking out. We were charged $140 per night for 3 nights and $167 for the last night. The night manager told us that the regular rate on the room was $167 per night during the week, and $219 on the weekend. Ten percent off of 167 is 140, but 10 percent off 219 is not 167. So the math makes no sense. The web site for the resort shows a rate of $129 per night for this room and a weekend rate for Friday night of $219. When I checked out, the manager repeated the same values as the night manager and added that the the CAA discount included a $4 discount off the $14 breakfast buffet. But, the same manager gave me CAA vouchers for free breakfasts all week when I checked in.   I phoned the CAA to get rates for the week of July 9th. None of the rates quoted by the CAA matched any of the rates given to me by the resort. Also, the CAA representative told me that the resort is not listed as being eligible for a CAA discount. However, the Carriage Ridge resort, which is part of the same complex as the Horseshoe Resort, is available for a CAA discount. The rate for a 2 bedroom condo including a fireplace, kitchen, balcony, and washer and dryer, is $169 a night. That is quite a contrast. The night manager gave me a print out of my account for the first three nights. She told me that we would receive a full receipt of the charges through our door in the early morning before check out. We did not recieve this receipt and I was not offered a receipt when I checked out. Overall, the management of the reservations and pricing is incoherent.  If it were not for the confusing pricing issues and the loss of a personal item, I would be happy to give Horseshoe Resort a high rating. For $713 in total we had 4 nights in a nice resort including a nice buffet breakfast. The facilities and staff were consistently pleasant. Some rough edges are showing due to age, but efforts are clearly being made to maintain the resort. The 5% activity fee added to the charges is not unusual, but adding the same 5% activity fee to the food and drink in the somewhat pricey restaurants on site seems a bit overdone. I might consider returning if it were not for the disturbing loss of a personal item.",3,negative
133768700,barrie/ca/154980/185603/133768700.html,Horseshoe Resort,"We were there over the weekend July 6-8th. When we got there we were completely taken back by our room. The room looked like it hadn't been update since the 90's. There were multiple stains on the walls, ceiling, lamp shades, couch... The furniture looked like it had been pulled out of a garage. Just because the website pictures look nice, doesn't mean you are going to get an updated room. Make sure you call ahead to make sure you get a renovated room.  To top all that, a shirt was stolen right from my bag. At first I thought, maybe I didn't pack the shirt, so I waited until i got home to make sure... sure enough, it""s not at home. Then I come on here and read that a flat iron was also stolen from a guest this same weekend. I then called and informed them that my shirt was taken. Then said ""they have had no problems with their cleaning staff..."" Clearly they have, when the flat iron issue just came up in the same weekend.!   All in all... never ever going back to this resort.! Very disappointing!

133987526,barrie/ca/154980/185603/133987526.html,Horseshoe Resort,"My wife and I stayed at this report July 3 to July 7, 2012. We were offered a the choice between an old style first floor room or a thrid floor room that was newly renovated. The older room was fine, but the the 3rd floor room was much preferable. The beds were great for sleeping. The furniture was new. There were attractive new louvres on the windows and the bathroom had been completely redone with a modern shower stall. TV was digital but there was no digital signal. Fridge is included. Some minor finishes are required to complete the work, but nothing significant.  The staff were consistently courteous and pleasant to deal with. The buffet breakfast was nice, but became monotonous day after day. We had dinner in the Crazy Horse one night. The food was good, but somewhat overpriced and there is a 5% facilities charge on top which is rather absurd considering the room rate contains the same 5% charge. We decided to not indulge in the Slik restaurant for this reason.   The Adventure area looked well maintained and laid out. I expect families with kids would have a lot of fun. The Ogo in particular looked like a lot of fun. The other activities, such as tree trekking, are not common. The prices for these may quickly exceed your budget, but the quality of the offering appeared good. Having no children with us, we did not explore this area. And we are not golfers, so we cannot comment on this. The indoor pool was very nice. The temperature was perfect and the pool and hot tub were clean and well maintained. The outdoor pool next to the indoor pool was not open. We had to use the outdoor pool at the lodge or short walk from the Inn. This pool was also well maintained and a comfortable temperature. This pool was very busy at times, but almost empty at others, so pick your moment. Lots of chairs to choose from. The interior public areas of the lodge and Inn were a bit tacky in spots due to wear and tear, but there is obviously ongoing efforts to address these issues.   Unfortunately, our stay was sullied by deceptive rates and questionable ethics. These were described in detail in my wife's review. We were told that they honor CAA discounts and we were quoted a discounted price but never received the promised confirmation. I was asked for my CAA card upon arrival. This was a ruse. We were charged the full rate, plus the cost of a breakfast that we were told was free with the discount. The CAA confirmed to me that this resort is not eligible for CAA discounts. I believe this ruse was an attempt to capture business by the reserving agent. We never received a break down of the bill, only a summary. It is impossible to decipher how the final bill was calculated. It looks like the room rate during the week was $143.77 per night before all taxes and charges. On top of this ruse, our cleaning service was not delivered on our 2nd nights stay and a personal item was removed from the room on the 3rd afternoon while the cleaning staff were in the room. We complained but did not receive a follow up from management as promised regarding the missing item.   I cannot recommend this resort due to the misrepresented pricing and questionable cleaning staff.

135383132,barrie/ca/154980/185603/135383132.html,Horseshoe Resort,"We stayed here (2 adults, 2 kids) for one night only and probably won't ever return. Yes the room was dated, there were no cribs/playpens, no fridge and the outdoor pool disappointingly wasn't even filled, but my main complaint is the absolute lack of communication with guests.   You would think a 'resort' type of lodging would at least have some sort of book/binder/brochure/pamphlet in the rooms, especially since there is an attached 'Adventure Park' and activities - but no, nothing informing guests of hotel amenities or activities.  As a result, I went up to the front desk numerous times to ask, inquire and get a map and still it was only after seeing a bunch of 6-year-olds returning mini-golf clubs to the front desk did I learn that we could also play the mini golf that otherwise looked unstaffed and closed...After walking through a bunch of hallways to the crowded indoor pool with baby in tow did I realize I had to walk all the way back to the front desk for pool towels. A sign here and there would be very helpful.  The best part of our stay, besides running around the (closed) Adventure Park was the morning buffet breakfast and the coffee in the lobby.

We stayed at Horseshoe Valley and loved every second! I had not been there before. We stayed in the Inn and found the room to be clean, spacious and the beds incredibly comfortable. The staff were extremely pleasant and helpful. On the first day we played mini-golf on the course they have set into the hills. It was the best mini-golf course we have every seen - lots of fun and we were surprised to find the ""roughs"" and ""sand traps"" and it was definitely a course for both kids and adults. We relaxed by the outdoor pool in the afternoon. That night we ate at Silks Restaurant and had a truly delicious dinner. The restaurant was very busy yet the service was attentive and the food was terrific. We had a nice corner table and enjoyed a romantic dinner watching the sun set. The next day we went to their Adventure Park. We went zip-lining - SO MUCH FUN! Then we had great fun in OGO - climbing into a giant ball and rolling down the hill. We laughed so much. We had lunch at Crazy Horse and ate outside on the deck. The food was very good pub fare, the servings large and the waitress friendly. We will definitely go back and we will take our teenaged children with us next time to do more zip-lining and try the tree-top Trekking, Segway and downhill mountain biking. The spa was very busy so I would recommend booking spa treatments in advance. We will also go back in the winter to enjoy their snow season. What a great place to relax and have fun just an hour from Toronto!

136841952,barrie/ca/154980/185603/136841952.html,Horseshoe Resort,"I am not sure where to start with this review due to the fact that if you are looking at an event at Horseshoe there is only one other hotel / resort in the area so you may be stuck. First of all a little background. My job requires an inordinate amount of travel. Much of it is international involves resorts or conference hotels. I recently counted business trips to 40+ countries over the past 5 years alone. I typically stay at hotels over 200 nights per year and have stayed in everything from cockroach infested concrete buildings in sub Saharan Africa to incredible properties operated by the 4 Seasons, Mandarin and Shangri La. The majority of the time I stay at Hilton properties which I would typically classify as 4 star by North American standards. When I read reviews (particularly negative ones) I often wonder what the experience or expectations of the posters was. Hopefully this background provides some perspective.   In all of my years of traveling I have never been so dissatisfied with a stay. My fiancee and I booked a room at the Horseshoe Resort well over 6 months in advance for a weekend event. Rooms were booked solid everywhere within 45 minutes which is typically a sign that the property will be ""stressed"" so my expectations were not elevated. I will not post the type of subjective rant that I often see on TA but will provide some examples. When we originally booked our room I was very clear about the room class being booked and amenities. When we arrived our room was not available however we were offered ""something close to our booking"" in the words of the front desk clerk who was very pleasant.   When we arrived at our room the level of amenities was lower than what we had expected for $ 249 + taxes but we could have lived with that if it was simply a minor variation. The room itself was filthy. The toilet was plugged from the previous guests. There was dried mud all over the tile in the entry way and the view that we had been promised was of a construction site at the back of the property. Piles of debris, stacks of glass and scaffolding. We also had only a single towel in the room. I called the front desk and was told that they were booked beyond capacity and that there was nothing that could be done about a move. I was then informed that if I wanted to visit the front desk that I could certainly pick up towels and a plunger. Although dismayed I went down to the front desk, collected towels and a plunger to clear the toilet in our room. As I was clearing the toilet in our room I noticed that the toilet bolts were very loose. You could hold the toilet rock it up and town and rotate the bowl over 2"" in each direction. Of course this resulted in a slow constant leak and noxious smell. We then decided to try the shower. The shower head had not been installed properly and every time you turned on the full pressure 50% of the flow would shoot up against the ceiling where the shower head met the downspout.  At this point we decided to walk back to the front desk to discuss our issues in person. On my way down I ran into another group of individuals that we knew and related our issues. They informed me that the outdoor hot tubs were out of order and that the tiles around the indoor pool were filthy. During our conversation I also found out that the other couple had an identical room however their rate was significantly lower than our own. Interesting.  When I arrived at the front desk there were two very young ladies working. From my experience dealing with airlines, hotels and restaurants over the years I know that the best policy is to remain completely calm and relaxed. As soon as I started relating the issues during our brief stay one of the ladies immediately went on the offensive raising her voice at me and disputing our claims. She denied any problems with the room, insisted that every guest in the resort (irrespective of room class) was paying the same rate. When I asked for a map of the 7 dining options listed on the web site she indicated that the closed for the season beaver tail hut across the parking lot is actually considered one of the dining options. When I suggested that we felt that we had been misled about the resorts facilities and that the state of our room was not indicative of a $ 249 charge she yelled at us while pointing at the phone that people were calling every 5 minutes asking about rooms and that if we didn't like it we could leave.   At that point the second young lady at the desk literally jumped in front of the other young lady apologized profusely and took down our name for the GM to call as there were ""no Managers available to speak to"". She was obviously embarrassed at the behaviour of her co-worker as well as the state of the property.  The breakfast buffet is on par with lower end chains with free breakfast buffets. Think Hampton Inn, Fairfield etc etc.  We checked out the following morning and are unlikely to ever return to Horseshoe Resort again. Over the last 20 days I have subsequently stayed at the 4 Seasons Whistler, the Nita Lake Lodge Whistler and Opus Vancouver. All were exceptional properties with professional staff. All including the 4 Seasons Whistler (which I would describe as heavenly) were at a lower price point than the Horseshoe. Next week I am off to Europe on business to stay at another selection of properties. Since our stay at Horseshoe I have remained dismayed and continue to discuss our treatment with staff at every other property that I have visited along with co-workers and customers.  The only explanation that I can come up with is that Horseshoe has no real competition in the immediate vicinity and cater to many individuals with very limited travel experience. Many of the staff also appear to be seasonal employees with limited training. If you are looking to stay at a nice resort hotel this is not the place to stay particularly at this price point. That being said if you have to be at Horseshoe and can handle the abuse you can't be any closer.",1,negative

We stayed in the condos at the resort. The rooms were very spacious. They had 2 bedrooms and bathrooms in it. However, the rooms were very run down. There were lots of flies in the room, the tubs and toilets had stains on them, the pillows were awful to sleep on, there was a coffee machine with no coffee pot and when I went to get cutlery from the drawer, I found a hair on the spoon. The room wasn't clean at all.   We notified front desk that there was no coffee pot and they said they would send someone to give us one. Never came.   Our friend's didn't have a great experience either. They took a shower one night and there was no hot water and their AC broke down in the room.  On Saturday, we received a letter stating that Hydro One would be doing some work and there would be no electricity or hot water from 530am-9am. To compensate for this, the resort gave us 2 bottles of water and a glow stick. I understand that the work being done by Hydro One is out of their control. However, I think they could have done more to compensate for the inconvenience. In the letter they provided us, they asked guests to have breakfast at the resort restaurant. Many thought this was complimentary. However, upon arrival found out that customers had to pay.   I was traveling with a young child who needed to have warm milk at 7am. When we called front desk to ask if there was anywhere we could get hot water, the staff said not until 9am. So, I woke up at 5am to boil water and poured it into a thermos to keep it warm. Lucky I had a thermos otherwise, I don't know how I would have made my daughter's bottle.  We felt the power outage was not dealt with accordingly. To keep customers happy, I believe the resort could have done more than give 2 bottles of water and a glow stick.   The adventure park was fun for the kids. They did have a lot of activities for the children (rock climbing, maze, trampoline, pony ride for $5). They even had zip-lining for adults.   We also booked a massage and pedicure at the Shizen spa. The staff at the spa were very friendly and professional.  Overall, if you go to the resort, visit the adventure park and the spa but I would not recommend staying there. The accommodations were not up to standard. I have paid similar prices for stays at other hotels and the condition of the rooms were much better.",2,negative
137382021,barrie/ca/154980/185603/137382021.html,Horseshoe Resort,"We have been going to Horseshoe annually for approximately seven years with our two daughters. It has slowly become extremely rundown, but our most recent stay was a huge disappointment to say the least. When we drove up to the Inn, we noticed that the outdoor pool was emptied and not operational. The front desk informed me that the pool was closed permanently and that we would have to use the outdoor pool located by the ""condo"" which is used by time share owners. The pool at the condo was extremely busy with teenagers and young children jumping in the pool and yelling plus there appeared to be at least three summer camps using the pool and hot tub as well. The pool at the Inn was quieter and geared more towards adults. The condition of the hotel itself was terrible. The corridors had stained carpets, our hotel room had a curtain rod that had been pulled out leaving holes in the wall with miscoloured paint where it was, the bathroom had pink outdated tiles, no bedskirts on the beds and other holes in the walls. I made mention to the receptionist of the state of our room upon check out telling her that they may want to address the room because it did appear quite rundown. The receptionist laughed and said ""oh maybe we should look at the rooms more often"". I even left a comment card that was given to the manager with no follow up phone call regarding our concerns. In addition to these issues, my room had a charge from the Crazy Horse restaurant from the previous guest. Will not go back even though the activity park and area are beautiful and it had become a family tradition. Their priorities seem to be with the park and building new condos and not maintaining existing building and business. Very disappointed.",2,negative
137908831,barrie/ca/154980/185603/137908831.html,Horseshoe Resort,"A large group of us stayed for a night due to a large event taking place in town. While our husbands participated in the event, the ladies planned a spa/pool day. For a group of mothers we were very excited to get away from it all and relax. This was not the case.  We stayed in rooms 401 and 402 which is a condo style room. Upon reaching the door we noticed the awful and unfinished paint on the door. This was nothing big but it was a poor first impression. This is nothing compared to the state of the room once we opened the door. There were stains on the carpet and they were everywhere. It was unreal! The bathrooms were gross an it looked as if the shower had not been cleaned from the previous guests. Despite the gross room we decided not to worry and head to the spa. We spent about $600 in total between 5 girls in spa services. I decided to go with a pedicure. During the service, the woman working with me did not provide a full pedicure service. There were a number of issues. Basically I got a polish change while the two other woman getting the same treatment got a massage and moisturizers applied. The woman working on me would stop and chat often. This service was not worth the $71 I was charged. I mentioned this while paying and the woman said that the person was new and contracted out by the spa so she is unfamiliar with the treatment (really??? Why not fully prepare her??). She told me there was nothing she could do but I could talk to the manager the next day. The next day I went back and met with the spa manager. She offered to redo the treatment which I appreciated but we were checking out and had to get home to relieve babysitters. I left with a card that states that I am entitled to another pedicure on my next visit because she said she would not reimburse me the money I paid. We live two hours away and have a baby. There is no way I could get away, drive two hours, get a pedicure and drive 2 hours back home. Not happy with the outcome. We spent a lot of money (approx $600 on the 2 rooms, over $600 at the spa and over $500 at Silks the restaurant) and felt that it was nit worth the money at all. Too bad because I am sure it ""could"" be a great place to bring the kids considering all the activities available.",2,negative

Food at the main restaurant ""Silk"" was very good but again expensive. Some areas looked rundown like the outdoor pool which was not operational and small areas clearly need replacing. Our second night, we had to go to bed early since we had to leave the resort at 3:30am. To our excitement there was a wedding going on and our room was right beside the big white tent. We went to bed at 9am but could not go to sleep due to the head banging bass of the speakers, objects were even vibrating in the room it was soo loud.   We kept calling down asking when it was going to be over, the first person said 11pm. We called down at 11:25pm and then they said 12am. We called down for a third time at 12:15am and they said 1am. We just gave up and left. No point in sleeping here if you can't go to sleep. You think they would have the hotel guests on the opposite side of the hotel from where the tent is and the wedding guests on the side where the tent is. Common sense really. So we ended up leaving at 12:30am to Windsor and just slept in the car. Figured we would get some sleep in the car instead of staying at the resort. For the price of the room ($230/night), this totally was not worth it and I don't think i will ever go back.   The only highlight I had and was really impressed was the one man that worked in the adventure park. My boyfriend and I were looking for a bike pump for the downhill mountain biking. The girls in that tack shop were clearly useless <this is after paying the $22 or so $$ just to be able to do the downhill biking> and they pretty much gave me the impression that I was SOL and wouldn't even attempt to help me. I figured there has to be one here, since there was over 20 bikes sitting outside the tack shop that the park rented out. We found this one guy that went head over heels for us to track down a bike pump and he eventually found one at the front of the resort <which he drove and picked up for us>. Plus the boys at the lift were trying t o track down a pump for us too which was awesome. I really appreciate the help.  All in all, I won't go back.",1,negative

Horseshoe now surcharges everything by a 5% Resort Amenity Fee, then charge 13% HST on on the Amenity Fee. A total extra charge of 18.65%! This is not explained on any of their signs. The on-site snack bar charges $2.25 + 18.65% for a half-liter bottle of water. And they resell Cosco's Kirkland brand water, which you can buy for less than 10 cents at Costco! Talk about atrocious mark ups.  Last but not least, we found ourselves in long line-ups for short rides. For example, we lined up for 90 minutes for the ZIP-line ride which lasted less than one minute. The OGO ride, another long wait/short trip ride, soaks you in almost freezing cold water. This deters all but the very young.  The best ""ride"" was the 18-hole, 3-tiered mini-golf.  All in all, not a great time was had. But Horseshoe certainly knows how to surcharge.

We were told the zipline had rules, only closed toe shoes allowed, but we saw people go on with sandles and barefeet. Park rules seemed to apply for some, not all. Keep in mind we went on Wednesday - and the wait was unacceptable and unreasonable for a weekday with few people in the park. My children waited another hour for the Euro bungey. The staff that supervised the euro bungey seemed sluggish, taking their time, applying sunscreen, talking and basically holding up the line. I was so upset by how indifferent and inattentive the staff seemed to be. They just didn't care, customer service really lacked. The OGO ball was great, that was the only attraction that seemed to move fast, my kids waited 20 minutes for that adventure. All in all, we will not go back to horseshoe, it's just not worth it!

We stayed in the condo style rooms which had lots of space, a great balcony, and plenty of storage. Yes the rooms are very dated and in need of a makeover, but with a three year old I wasn't at all worried about ruining the carpet etc. so it didn't bother me to much.(Although a King bed would of been sweet) Also, our door to our room didn't lock and the remotes were dead. However, (while it would of been nice to have these issues addressed ahead of our arrival) maintenance was sent right over to fix them. Our little one loved the pools, mini gold and maze. Having a playground and lots of pathways to walk was also a great added bonus. Lots to do and see. All adult family members took part in some extra activities too including, hummer tours, tree top trekking and zip lining. While we enjoyed yummy groceries delivered each day, (chicken, veg, pasta salad and snacks) the Crazy Horse Restaurant was a bit of a let you downer. In fact we went off site for one of our meals and only ate at the Crazy Horse 2x. The menu is boring, food average, and service slow. The atmosphere is also tired but it was the only family friendly, (again we have a 3year so the Silks Children' s menu was not an option for us) place to eat. I would love for it to step it up and become an asset to the resort. We often drive through this area and it would be great if the Crazy Horse attracted you back. As it is now, we would plan to eat most meals in the condo and travel off site for dinner next year. I hope Horseshoe steps up the Crazy Horse and offers some better tasting meals, and quicker service Overall though, we enjoyed a great 3 days, had lots of fun, and will be returning.

Not a single sign is posted on the entire lot, from the hours the park is open untill to the weight restreingths on the rides (it would just make everyones life easier). You get to the front of an hour long line just to figure out you weight too little or too much for that specific attraction. The lines are just attrocious and fanquily not worth it. If you are lucky enough to get a room in the inn, the rooms are to an average or above average standard. But on the other hand if you are one of the many other guests in the condo building the rooms are much below standart with a terrible use of space and extreamly outdated! The indoor pool is nice but quite crouded, the outdoor pool is in a nice area but my guess is it hasn't been cleaned in 3-4 weeks seeing as there is a protective coding of dead bugs and tree bits relaxing on the top layer of the water. Overall i'm just not sure if it's worth it. It's a good experience to have but defenitly not one i will treasure forever!

139052616,barrie/ca/154980/185603/139052616.html,Horseshoe Resort,"I booked two rooms at Horseshoe a two bedroom condo and a hotel room. Two adults, 10 year old and four teenagers. The two bedroom condo is dated – inside and especially from the outside. Once inside loads of space, nice lay out, fire place (just call front desk for logs), screened in balcony....This room is a perfect spot for skiing in the winter. The hotel room was more modern and was your basic room. Would be great for overnight golf. Indoor pool at the hotel and outdoor pool at the condo unit. Outdoor pool by the hotel closed. Outdoor pool at the condo very large, very warm and we enjoyed the hot tub as well. For a great pool like that they need to organize the space around it and do some flowered pots – make it inviting! Guests can use both pools it doesn't matter where you stay. All the staff are very friendly but organized communication is missing. Because a lot of the activities are separate businesses they have to be booked and reserved individually - it gets confusing try to organize everything. I felt I was doing way too much work for all of it. Plus I was getting different quotes from different people. If you want to do Tree Trecking, Horse Back Riding, Segway, bike tour.......... you want to book them on line before you go – that way you are guaranteed to get them. They all cost extra. Adventure Park – nice to be outside with the great view. The park needs some reconsideration. I have gone to the Park before and they made some changes that just don't work for families. The activities that you pay extra for are the best for teenagers. The free stuff didn't fly with any of my teens so be prepared for the extra costs. The adventure park has some things for the five and under range. But the middle group is missing. My son who is almost 11 was four pounds too light for the zip line. But they had nothing to offer in place off it. He did the rock climbing but it really is an easy climb. The maze took him 10 minutes. The Ogo ball has freezing cold water and very slow to get through the line. He went once. When we realized there wasn't much for him to do we tried booking things but of course they were full. He was too young for the Segways. They use to have summer tubing and a skateboard/ bike park but they removed them. Mini golf was fun but because it was the only activity that all ages can do - it was very busy. For 4 to 6 year olds there is enough to do in this park. My teenagers loved the Tree Trecking aprox $60 per person. My son and I did the horse back riding $55 per person for 45 minutes – gorgeous trail and view – walking horses only. Golf – Horseshoe Highlands a must!   Overall a nice stay. Great for my teenagers - for an additional $$$ cost. My son 10 who doesn't complain said he was disappointed but did enjoy horseback riding. I think for next time we will just book one of the activities like Tree Trecking and go out for the afternoon.",3,negative

The Inn is located at the bottom of the ski hill (some of the chalets are at the top). Directly across from the tavern/chalet.  Check-in was a breeze. Since we booked a weekend stay and ski our lift passes were given to us right away at check-in - which of course saves time in the morning for more skiing! The package included a night ski pass the day you arrive, one day ski pass, two nights accomodation, and a full breakfast. The lobby is pretty with a nice fireplace. The Inn also has a pool, hot tub, and sauna located on the main floor and hot tubs and a small skating rink outdoors.  The room was decent. We were on the second floor. It's needs a bit of sprucing up (ie. new linens, carpet, etc) but was very clean. Same goes for the bathroom - could have used a reno but clean. The bathroom also had a heat lamp with is nice when you come in from a cold day.  The breakfast was great. Full buffet style breakfast with eggs, bacon, cereals, loads of fruit, bagels, etc. Pretty packed but we had a table within 5 minutes of arriving. Serving staff were quick to refill our coffees and juice. If your package does not include breakfast you can purchase it - can't how much though. The Inn also has a piano bar but we didn't try it out so I can't comment.

I'm sure they vacuum and change the sheets, but real cleaning seems to be quite lacking, as evidenced by the many, many, stains, dirty windows, and dirt in corners of the unit.   The pool had a constant film of bugs and other detritus. There was never any indication of pool cleaning, or in fact any cleaning at all around the condos. The ""gym"" was a joke and very run down looking. Overall the building looked cheap and getting cheaper. There was graffiti in places (gangs in Barrie???) and no sign of attempts to remove it.   Finally, the food options in this place are horrific. Expect to pay outrageous amounts for really, really bad food. Pretend you are in Disney, but without the big rides or anything worth travelling to.   One last thing...they claim to have mountain biking. There are no legitimate trails on site. There are some in the area, but none here, so it would be preferable to stay somewhere else if mountain biking is your goal.

I was lucky to stay in one of the renovated rooms (suite) and I have to agree it was very nicely done. Bathroom very clean, big soak bath, glass shower, nice spacious room with extra sitting area and fireplace. Where they really need improvement is food. I am not a health freak but definitely watch what I put in my body and they are lucking a healthy choices. Otherwise I can't complain, the services was great the amenities are decent, I had a great time overall.
 
 
 Room Tip:  Make sure to ask for a renovated suite or deluxe room.

The best way to describe it in one word ""Excellence"". I stayed in a large room with a jacussi, fireplace and a large very comfortable bed. The rooms were cleaned very well every day. There is a golf course, ski hill and trails. The hills weren't open when we were there. There were trails for walking. The spa was great. They have large conference rooms that can accomodate large groups. The food at the restauarants was excellent. The staff were very accomodating and pleasant. I would highly recommend this resort for weekend getaways for couples, and great for groups. I will definitely be returning here in the future.",5,positive

The renovated suite was spacious and well appointed - with a comfy king bed, a sparkling clean bathroom and a sitting area by the fireplace. I haven't stayed at any of the old rooms, but based on the reviews I've read - paying a bit extra for the renovated rooms makes perfect sense.   As for the food - Crazy Horse is your standard average pub food (we had lunch there and were not impressed), but Silks is fine dining at its best. We enjoyed dinner there and were very happy we did - it has great atmosphere and delicious food.   Dining and accommodations aside, what really made a difference was the service - from the front desk, to the restaurant to the attendants at the Nordic Skiing center - everyone I spoke with was smiling and seemed to go out of their way to help.",5,positive

We enjoyed the pool and the hot tub and skiing and snow tubing but what made this place great was the service. At every step of the way, from the front desk to the restaurants to the house keeping, everyone went out of their way to help you, even when you know that they didn't have to. By the way, the restaurants were great! Fine dining at Silks was excellent, not expensive but the food was truly amazing. Even Crazy Horse, for casual dining the food was great. Good job Horshoe. We have been skiing here for years and this was our first stay. Won't be the last!

148563606,barrie/ca/154980/185603/148563606.html,Horseshoe Resort,"I've visited Horseshoe Resort for years, mostly for alpine and cross country skiing (once for tree-top trekking), but this is the first time I've ever stayed (we booked a condo at Valley Suites). While the staff should be commended for their friendliness, the overall quality of this resort leaves something to be desired.  Lets start with the positive. As mentioned, the staff is great. Almost everyone we met was friendly, courteous and helpful. This included the front desk staff, to the ""lift staff"", to the restaurant staff.  The skiing was also great. We arrived for night skiing on new year's eve, and while only a selection of runs were open, they offered a decent variety of challenge. However, I would not recommend Horseshoe for advanced skiers, as there are no challenging runs (at least at night), but for beginners and intermediate level, it should be fine. If you're looking for something with a bit of a challenge, you're probably better off elsewhere, or perhaps try the day when there are a few more runs open. We were also able to do some Nordic skiing the next day and it was perfect. Those people (especially John) are some of the nicest and most helpful we've met on this trip, and they made the rental process for my friends very smooth. The trails were well groomed, and I must say, the scenery was beautiful. It has been a few years since I've been to Horseshoe and I don't remember the more difficult trails, but we did tackle the beginner and intermediate trails this time and they were very enjoyable. If you have friends or kids who are just starting, these trails are suitable for them.  Now for the negative. Although the skiing was good, the rest of the Horseshoe experience was less than good. Things were rocky right from the beginning. The booking process seemed smooth enough. The agent was polite and helpful, but did not send me a confirmation email when they said they would. We booked a condo suite for new year's eve and since availability was very limited at this time, a confirmation would have been appreciated. Several attempts to reach the reservation centre by phone were made in the subsequent days after booking, but none were successful. A request for call-back was ignored. In any case, it wasn't until my credit card was charged did I assume that we had a room. I did finally end up reaching service prior to arriving to confirm. When the date finally arrived, we ended up arriving at the lodge around 5 pm. Check-in is scheduled for 4 pm, but our room was not ready. In fact, it wasn't ready until around 6 pm. Normally it's not a big deal, but I'm willing to bet most people don't drive in from out of town already dressed for skiing. We certainly didn't. Our ski attire was packed away, and therefore we needed access to our rooms to facilitate the retrieval of our gear. The fact that our room was not ready cut into our time on the hill which closes at 10 pm. From what we could tell, we were not the only group that was having this problem, and one family with 5 kids were waiting over two hours for their room. I should mention, check-out is at 11 am. I understand that it takes time to clean rooms, but if you can't clean these rooms in 5 hours with the staff you have, it seems apparent that more staff is required. Now, I can wait an extra hour for our room and, sure 1 less hour of skiing isn't the end of the world, but the room was atrocious, which is inexcusable! Yeah, it's cozy enough under normal circumstances, I suppose, but for 500 dollars I expect near perfection (heck, I'd settle for just clean and a good night's sleep). It was far from perfect. I'm sure housekeeping was rushed since the front desk literally badgered them to get this room cleaned, quick and we got it minutes after they were done. But it is simply unacceptable to have a washroom smelling like B.O., sticky counter tops in the kitchen and missing pillow cases. Also, this is probably not on housekeeping (unless they're suppose to clean the ducts), but turning on the heat causes a musty, allergy-inducing odor to be expelled into the room. Furthermore, and probably the worst offense of all (if you're unlucky enough to get the room facing the parking lot and walkway, i.e. not the master bedroom) the walls are paper thin! It tends to snow there and the snow needs to be plowed (at 5 am), but why on earth they use a bulldozer with a back-up warning beep that could raise the dead, I can not answer. Those things are not exactly quiet going forward either! One could not be blamed for thinking the apocalypse was occurring right outside the door. There must be quieter options. I won't even get into how the noise from fellow guests walking by (drunk or otherwise) resonates into the room. Suffice it to say, sleep did not occur that night and X-country skiing the next morning was more of a challenge than necessary.  Finally, I would like to mention the food since there doesn't seem to be many options nearby. We had the opportunity to sample the food in the restaurant in the chalet (not the cafeteria) and Silk.  The food in the restaurant in the chalet was good. It's mostly pub fare with an interesting assortment of poutine. I had the sweet potatoe poutine which my group thought sounded disgusting, but I quite enjoyed it. I also had the kettle chips which were delicious. This restaurant accomplishes what it intended.  Silk on the other hand, I cannot say for certain. Our hotel package came with breakfast at Silk which was served buffet-style. While certainly adequate for most places, I feel like Silk sets itself up to be a high-end ""fine dining"" experience and maybe it is, for dinner or lunch, I don't know, but for breakfast, not so much. Indeed, the assortment of food was impressive (and in abundance!), from warm meats, to omelets, to bread to chicken (alfredo?) pasta and desserts, but none of what I had was anything to write home about. Kind of disappointing was that the ""hot"" food I had was barely warm at best. Perhaps I'm judging too harshly. It's a buffet, after all. The food there will probably delight most, but expectations are not met if you consider what Silk tries to be. The staff is great though. Perhaps the best thing on the resort are the beaver tails. Do yourself a favour and head outside to the hut near the ski racks and pick one of these up. :)  Horseshoe Valley Resort is a great place to spend the day. The friendly staff, and cozy environment make it a pleasure to come to time and again. However, if you need to stay in the area, I can't recommend it, especially at the prices they charge. I'm not sure if there are any other options within 20 minutes, but even if you have to drive in from Barrie, it would probably be the preferable option.

We have always found the management and staff to be awesome. If there's a problem, because that's life, they will fix it. Special kudos to Shannon at the Inn, and to ALL the serving staff at the Crazy Horse, where we eat every Friday night during ski season.

150821787,barrie/ca/154980/185603/150821787.html,Horseshoe Resort,"Stayed at the resort just recently with family and friends and all of us ( a group of 8 ) had a blast. We stayed at the older side of the resort however the rooms were clean and spacious with a breathtaking view. I heard most of the resort has been renovated and the new rooms are very luxurious but frankly, we didn't care that much since we went there to ski and not stay in our rooms. We've skied at Horseshoe before but never stayed at the Inn and honestly, we should have stayed here earlier. It was a great place to be for a mini ski vacation - the stay and ski package was an awesome deal. Having the ski lifts at our doorstep made all the difference for us and added about 3 extra hours of skiing every day which otherwise we would have spent on the highway travelling back and forth from TO to the resort. The hot tub was a big hit and such a nice way to warm up after skiing on the coldest few days so far this season ( T dropped down to -24 with the wind-chill on our last day there ). It was truly a must after a day out in the cold and even the kids liked soaking in it. There is a dry sauna and a spa on the property as well. The buffet breakfast was great, with somewhat limited variety but very tasty and fresh. The most valuable asset of the resort however is the staff. Extremely friendly, always smiling and eager to help, they made our stay truly a memorable one - from letting us check in a bit earlier through all the questions we had for the restaurants in the area to extending our reservation for an additional day at the same rate we booked it weeks in advance ( we loved it so much & decided to stay an extra night ) - they went out of their way to make us feel welcome and well taken care of. I am already looking to book a few more days at the resort for an even bigger party of family and friends. We can't wait to go back!  The only thing I had a bit of a problem with were the pillows (too big and fat to be comfortable) and the A/C - a bit noisy. Bring your own pillow if you're a picky sleeper like me. Other than that, an excellent first stay that surely won't be our last!",5,positive
150880048,barrie/ca/154980/185603/150880048.html,Horseshoe Resort,"This hotel DOES NOT allow early check in. They use terms like ""pre-register"" by giving your ski tickets so you can hit the slopes but will still not let you inside your room.  This hotel DOES NOT allow late check-out. They will ask you to call them early morning to request for a late check-out which is on a ""first-come-first-serve"" basis. And tell you that the latest they can do is 12:00. Guess what, you can never check out any later than 12:00 anyways, whether you call or not.  Hot water is limited to the first 2 people in your family who takes a shower in the morning! The next person gets COLD water!!!  The Sales people at the Ski/Snowboard ticket counter will NEVER advice a novice to NOT BUY ski lift tickets, even after you tell them that you're just a beginner. Ski lifts are non-refundable. They don't care if they sold it to a novice.  So, let's say you want to use your ski lift, since you already paid for it, but not get off and just take some pictures and go down, they won't let you! YOU HAVE TO ski or snowboard your way down. They'd rather see you dead or get in an accident than let you go up and use your money's worth.  Oh yeah, blankets and pillows have cigarette holes and smells like cigarettes. I had nose-bleeding because of the dryness of the heat! in the rooms. And finally, elevators are so dimly-lit.

Rooms were very large, we picked the 2 bedroom studio. Bit dated, everything was old but did the job. We didn't expect anything upscale. Rooms were clean and decent. No complaints. Kitchen utensils / bowls / cups etc were dirty. Had to clean them before using. Used one of the cups in the morning for my coffee (brought my own instant coffee) and got the stomach flu a few hours later. Ended up puking the whole way home. DIdn't eat anything else so pretty much narrowed it down to the cup or my instant coffee which 5 other of my guests had as well and were fine. Nonetheless, because I'm not 100% sure im not pointing fingers, just stating that I recommend you clean everything before you use it (even though we did) LOL. Elevator was dingy (lights were so dim, felt like a scene from a horror movie). Some things that stood out: Heated Bathroom! (interesting). Large balcony (if you prefer to sit out there in the cold). Or if you go during the summer. Fireplace was a big plus, which came with one of those self starting logs. Swimming pool was about a 5 minute walk away and was nicely heated. All in all. Not bad.

151641087,barrie/ca/154980/185603/151641087.html,Horseshoe Resort,"I just stayed there this past weekend with my boyfriend. We stayed for 2 nights and 2 days of skiing. Neither of us had really skied much before so we signed up for lessons. Our instructor was Yan (Norwegian) and while we thought he was funny we could tell he didn't have a lot of patience if you didn't get it right quickly.   After we mastered the bunny hill we tackled some green slopes. Beware of the Pony Trail which says it's ""slow"" on the map but it is not. We were much more comfortable with the green slope on the far left of the map (22 I think). But by day 2 we had the courage to tackle a couple blue slopes.  The hotel room was nice but the shower could have been bigger given the overall size of the bathroom (no tub). Beds were comfy, place was clean and we enjoyed the breakfast buffet. No room service unfortunately, that would have been nice considering the dining options are limited to the restaurant in the hotel or Crazy Horse across the street. However, we ended up eating at Crazy Horse for almost all of our meals and never got tired of it. The staff are so friendly and on top of their game and the food was all delicious!  We will definitely go back here again if we have the chance. Considering it's only an hour north of Toronto, it's a great option.

Bar for drinks and restaurant for dinner in the building too. The only negative thing is that the breakfast at the restaurant is expensive. Adults pay $14 per person all you can eat, and children $12 which is absurt. How much can a 7 year old eat?? Overall, we payed $ 64 plus tips for breakfast.

We did not get an upgraded room but the room we did receive was spacious, on the main floor, with a gas fireplace and lowered sitting area. It definitely could use some upgraded floors etc as they were quite dated. Check in was smooth, we did get to check in about a half hour early. And the front desk staff were great, they even had a screwdriver upon request which we needed to adjust our bindings. We had dinner at the Crazy Horse which was more suitable then Silks for a 15 yo and 5yo. It wasn't bad, bit of a wait but that was to be expected. A little pricey though for pub food. We did try to request a late checkout the next day but when I called front desk a little after 8am they stated that they had given away all of their allotted late check outs already. ???? I found that a bit strange. Unfortunately, I did have to go home to drop off my dog and return to hit the slopes after. A bit of an inconvience. The boarding was great, perfect for beginners like my son and I. Although it was pricey, and I find a bit of a cash grab because the price was escalated for the holiday it was overall an enjoyable stay. It would have been nice to have a perk for people staying at the resort to have the lift passes start from your arrival to departure, not just the one day. I believe that is only if you buy the package through the resort.

The only negative experience we had was dining at the Crazy Horse restaurant. The food and price was ok, but the service was less that mediocre. Management needs to retrain the wait staff in customer service and hospitality. We ate at the cafeteria a few times and found the food good. The only downfall is trying to find a table. We also had the breakfast buffet a few times at the Inn and found the food good and price very reasonable. (5 and under free, kids $12, adults $14) I would recommend Horseshoe Valley Resort to all!

153220215,barrie/ca/154980/185603/153220215.html,Horseshoe Resort,"My husband and I stayed at Horseshoe Valley Resort February 23rd and checked out February 24th. We wanted a mini getaway to do some fun winter activities and that was exactly what we got. When we first arrived we walked around and noticed there was snowmobiling available in the activity park area. We had never done it before and were eager to try it. It was fun and not as expensive as we thought it would be. This is separate from the resort therefore they only accept cash and this can't be charged to your room. When we were done snowmobiling we checked in to our room since our mini getaway was booked last minute the only room that was available to us was a suite. It was beautiful, clean and spacious. The room had two queen beds, a sitting area with a fire place, flat screen tv, desk area with drawers, night table, a mini fridge, soaker tub and stand up shower in the washroom. My husband is a light sleeper and had a hard time staying asleep. The heat turns on every 20 minutes and this makes a loud exploding sound when it starts and rattling sound while it's on. I'm a heavy sleeper and this even woke me up a couple times during the night. Unfortunately there really isn't anything you could do about this but pay attention to it before going to sleep and if need be wear ear plugs before going to bed. We ate dinner at Crazy Horse. We were both impressed with the food and the iced tea. I wanted to eat light since we were off to do tubing after so I order salad that came with a crispy breaded brie, my husband had the four cheese pizza and both dishes were delish. We went tubing and had a fantastic time. Fun for all ages. The next day we had a buffet breakfast at Silks Dining Lounge nothing special just like any other hotel breakfast buffet but the food area is pretty small.   I would recommend this place if you are looking for some winter fun.",4,positive
153395284,barrie/ca/154980/185603/153395284.html,Horseshoe Resort,"Oh where to start? We stayed at the Horseshoe Resort for a few days of skiing. Check-in took an hour and still our room wasn't ready, though it was dinner time. We lost most of the night skiing hours because the reservations we had made for kids' lessons were misplaced -- another hour to find that and a loss of $400 for equipment rental and lift tickets that effectively went unused. (Incidentally, the skiing/rental cost is very high for this type of facility). The rental process was comically bad and slow. When we packed up, we found empty Pepsi cans under the bed from a prior guest. Yuck. We complained and received a call from a manager--the only compensation offered was a free night at the hotel. I informed her that we live over six hours away and would not be returning for another night but she offered nothing and never got back to me despite assurances she would do so. In the summer, we often stay at another property run by the same company (The Deerhurst) and I suggested that we be given a free night there instead, but no dice.",1,negative
153476427,barrie/ca/154980/185603/153476427.html,Horseshoe Resort,"We stayed at the resort for 3 days in February 2013. We scored an amazing online deal (follow them on Twitter for similar deals!) It included a renovated room (we've been told that most, if not all, the rooms are now renovated - they're doing huge upgrades to the resort), breakfast every morning and our lift passes.   The room was gorgeous, a large glass shower with adjustable height shower head, bar fridge, flat screen tv and comfortable beds with lovely bedding.   The hill is small, even by Ontario standards, but the snow was amazing. They do make snow and they groom the hill very well. It was the best snow I've skied on all year. There are no real black diamonds on the hill, though a few of the runs are labelled as such. The entire hill is very skiable terrain and there is lots of room for beginners to play around on. The lift attendants are super friendly. They are, by far, some of the best I've encountered over the years.   Crazy horse (the bar at the base of the hill) has the best sweet potato fries around. The rest of the food is your average pub fare. They removed the chair lift seats a while ago, it lost a bit of its charm.   The spa at the resort was fabulous. We had a great massage followed by a pedicure. Prices are reasonable for a resort spa and the pedicure is almost flawless 3 weeks (and many ski days) later.   The silks dining room was serving a prix fixe menu. 3 courses for $35. The food was delicious (in particular the roasted vegetables - we wished we'd been able to order a bowl of them!)   The included breakfast was quite the spread. It was buffet style, the food was hot, and there was a large selection. We definitely didn't go hungry. And the staff were very friendly as well.   If you're not a skier there are a number of other things to do: the hot tub and pool are open long hours, there is cross country skiing, snow shoe trails, skating, tubing and we saw a sign for dog sledding not far away (we spied it from the top of the runs!)   We've been here in the summer to trek in the tree tops (awesome) and play in the new adventure park. We'll be going back this year for some more fun in the sun.   This resort would be perfect for families.

153704352,barrie/ca/154980/185603/153704352.html,Horseshoe Resort,"We stayed overnight on a Saturday night for tubing. 2 Adults, 2 teens.  Check in was very fast and the front desk staff were very friendly and helpful with our questions.   The room is very large and spacious. We were very impressed with the layout and the view from our little sitting area by the fireplace. Beds were comfortable and there were plently of pillows and some extra blankets in the closet.   There was a coffee maker, bar fridge and flat screen tv. Normally there are movies available in room but there was some sort of an issue and the system was down while we were there.  The bathroom is very nice. The tub is all glass and very large. The tub is very large and deep as well (bring some bubbles!).  We only ate in the restaurant - Silks - for breakfast. There as a nice little buffet with hot/cold cereals, muffins, danish, banana bread, eggs, ham, bacon, pancakes and tater tots. There was also a toasting station for toast & bagels. Our waitress was very nice and super quick. We never had to ask for refils for coffee or milk/juice.  We went to the Adventure Park for tubing and the kids had a blast. It was $4.00 per ride or $20.00 for unlimited rides for 2 hours. We did the 2 hours and ended up being able to go down the hill about 12 times. This is about 10 minutes total to get up the hill, wait in line and then fly down the hill - which isn't bad at all. There are people at the bottom of the ""sidewalk"" as well as at the top to keep everything moving quickly and safely. There are also 2 people at the top of the hill. These guys were awesome and would spin you on your way down if you asked.  There is a ""moving sidewalk"" that takes you and your tube up the hill. Once at the top there are four lanes you can line up for.   The lines go really quickly. We were told that it was pretty busy but we only waited a few minutes each time to do down. You really get some speed and goggles or sunglasses help if it is windy but you don't have to have them. You can go down on your own or holding on to your group (up to 3 people).   There was a little snack shack by the hill with a bonfire which was nice too.  We didn't do any of the other activities but we saw the skiing/snowboarding and people snowshoeing. We also saw people heading down to do yoga.  We visited the pool area which has a large hot tub, pool and smaller kiddie pool (attached to the main pool). You have to stop at the gift shop for towels which is right on the way to the pool. There is a large changeroom that leads directly into the pool area. The pool area is not monitored by staff.  The hot tub was not really ""hot"" more bathlike. This was a bit of a problem as people were letting their kids ""swim"" and jump off the edge and into the hot tub. If the hot tub were ""hot"" this might alleviate this problem.   Overall this was a great weekend - I would definately recommend the hotel,restaurant and the tubing!

We had the impression that our room would not be ready unit 4pm but when we arrived at 11:30am, I was happily surprised that our room was ready. Nothing really to complain about other than I wished there was more of a variety of places to eat. We were left with either Crazy Horse which is like pub food (I didn't feel well after. Too much grease) or fine dining which was a bit pricey for me. It would be nice to see a couple of more varieties to choose from. Since i knew there was a fridge, I brought some of my own food. Saved us money. The breakfast buffet was great and had quite the variety such as eggs, sausages, pancakes or frech toast, a cereal station, a bagel and cheese station, fresh fruits, pasteries etc. The staff was friendly, the room was clean, and the skiing was great.",4,positive

We experienced 5-Star concierge-level service and encountered friendly staff everywhere on the resort ! Of course you're encouraged to see the Preview Centre in the hopes you'll like this area enough to purchase a condo/timeshare - not a bad deal, actually... The property is well kept, staff is exceptionally helpful and friendly, you're within 15 minutes of major shopping or you can just stick to a simple north country-setting. Whether travelling with kids or adults, there really is something for everyone. Available In-Room massage is a nice touch / hot-tub bath as well - the Ridge Club and Hills Club / fitness centres are complete with games room, pool (and wading pool for little ones), a jaccuzzi and even dvd rental. BBQ are available year-round but there are also great restaurants in the area, for all budgets. Nothing was left out of our room, from the fully-equipped kitchen to in-room entertainment, spacious and well-appointed. No complaints about cleanliness in any way. We will be back...  Quick mention about the Horseshoe Ski resort - rental staff (Andrew and Taylor) were extremely helpful... your staff can make or break your brand - these guys really helped to enhance our experience here.

We went straight to the spa at 10am and they were ready for us. Very friendly spa staff. The atmosphere beautiful, it was so perfect. When we were finished the room was ready and we had a beautiful view of the hill side. We went for lunch at their on site restaurant called The Crazy Horse and the service excellent and the food to die for! I would drive there just for the food it was that good. If you are a vegetarian you will love the food. I will go back to Horseshoe because the staff were all so friendly from the time we arrived to the time we left. If you go, try the tubing hill! the staff will make sure you have a laugh. :)

We stayed one night, and it included the room, 2 full days of skiing and buffet breakfast in the morning. Check-in was quick and easy, and we were accommodated for early check-in and ski passes without issue. We stayed in the condo-style room, and it exceeded expectation. It had 2 bedrooms, 2 bathrooms, living room with fireplace (including the fire log to burn!), a full kitchen with microwave, fridge, oven, kettle, coffee maker, and even a dishwasher. The room was also stocked with dishes and cutlery. Very convenient for families looking to make their own meals, like we did. There was also a washer-dryer in the room. We were even given a play pen for the baby to sleep in. The decor was a little dated, but the room was wonderful and very conveniently located right at the bottom of the ski hill, next to the restaurant and chalet. We could almost literally ski in and out of the building. And considering that it was March Break, it wasn't too crowded or too busy at all, which was very nice. The breakfast was in the main building where the reception is located, and breakfast was a hot and cold buffet, an abundance of selection to please just about anyone. Check-out was also quick and easy, and upon check-out with the package, you can stay and ski all day. We decided to stay and ski for several hours, and the staff was so friendly and accommodating, even after we checked-out, they provided us with a room so that I could nurse my baby in a quiet and private place. I found that the staff really went over and above to make things easy and convenient for our family.

154715435,barrie/ca/154980/185603/154715435.html,Horseshoe Resort,"As we relaxed on the couch in the living room of our two bedroom condo with a fire log burning in the fireplace, looking out at the brightly lit ski hills of Horseshoe Valley ski resort on the first of our three evening stay at Horseshoe Resort during the Ontario March Break, we could feel the tensions of the past few months melting away. What fortune to discover such a gem so close to Toronto. Our two bedroom, two bathroom condo unit came with a full kitchen, was much larger than we expected and was about the same price as a one bedroom suite half the size in a hotel we recently stayed at near Montreal. The three night stay entitled us to a thirty percent discount making it an exceptional value considering the location, amenities and convenient access to the ski hill. The pool and hot tub were clean and comfortable. Exercise equipment was excellent and functioning properly and there is a squash court available with free use of racquets and squash balls. All staff were professional and accommodating. We were able to have an early check in and late check out (this obviously depends on availability- if you want a clean room, there needs to be adequate time to clean the rooms after previous guests have departed). I’m not sure how Skyline can afford to provide this level of accommodation for the price they offered but our family will consider returning to Horseshoe Valley Resort without hesitation and I would recommend it without hesitation. The fifth floor condo units are especially nice because the enclosed porches have glass ceilings so there is lots of light and a wonderful view of the ski hills. One free fire log per evening was a nice touch. Thank you Skyline and Horseshoe staff for a wonderful, relaxing March Break! Hope you can continue to offer such exceptional value.

It had a full kitchen so we were able to save money by bringing our own food and just went to the pub for the last night. Spent a full day skiing/snowboarding right into the night which was terrific - almost no lift line-ups and runs that were challenging enough for us (though maybe not for more experienced skiers.) We could take breaks at our condo because they're right beside the hill. Tubing was fun - great staff at the top of the hill who work really hard. And snowshoeing through the trails was lovely. Our only complaints: the hide-a-bed in the condo was ""the most uncomfortable bed I've ever (not) slept in"" according to our oldest son. And the lyrics of the rap music they were pumping out of the speakers at the tubing run were not exactly family appropriate. (We went back later and they had changed the station so maybe someone complained.) But otherwise, a great three-day getaway that's nice and close for Toronto families.",4,positive

After learning from a co-worker that there was a deal for stay a 2nd night 50% off I decided to book a room. I called and spoke to the reservation lady who informed me that I was not permitted to take part of the deal because I could only book on Sunday. After I informed her that I wanted to book on Sunday she said that I was not allowed because the promotion ended that Sunday. I told her No, its not and read her the promotion which is (taken exactly from the Horseshoe's website)  STAY DATES:  Sunday thru Thrusday March 24th, 2013 – June 20th, 2013     BASE RATES:   Standard Room: Starting from $97/night* based on 2 nights, dbl occ Horseshoe Room: Upgrades available  Deluxe Room: Upgrades available     OFFSETS: Additional Adults $20 (ROOM) Children (age 6-16) FREE  INCLUDES: Accommodation  She then said she was unaware as to why I didn't qualify for the deal and perhaps the actual resort had blocked off that weekend. I explained to her that if that was the case then they should put a disclaimer that it's only for ""certain dates"" she said she didn't know why there wasn't and to call the resort. She then offered me to go online and Buy a WAGJAG deal I told her I wasn't interested in the deal and wanted the deal they were offering. I called the resort and the lady said that it was available and I could in fact book the deal as we went on to reserve the room she then said it was actually unavailable but couldn't give me a reason as to why. She explained that it was perhaps because it was the long weekend and that it was not available for that weekend. I then explained to her then Why would you not put a disclaimer on the PROMOTION? She couldn't give me an answer and said that it was probably because of the long weekend and that it makes more sense to make more money on the room. I was so upset, this promotion was on there website, I qualified for the deal as stated I was in the date, weekday, and time frame yet after all that I was not given any deal. I have never had such a run around, and uninformed reps and not to mention such HORRIBLE customer service. I work in business of customer service and our FIRST priority is our customers.

167578425,barrie/ca/154980/185603/167578425.html,Horseshoe Resort,"Loved every minute at this resort! Just returned from a 2 night stay there and did not want to leave! Stayed in the newly renovated hotel - rooms were clean and spacious. Pool area was clean and large with a 2 level pool and huge hot tub, dry sauna, squash gym etc. Value was amazing! Got an excellent deal for a package with hotel, spa services, adventure park passes with zip line and Ogo ball experience. The package was such a good deal I feel like I paid for the hotel and received the rest free! Ate at the Crazy horse - yummy food and value was good with very large portions. Had breakfast buffet at Silks. Food was ok and a great value at $14 per adult inclusive of unlimited beverages. Kids were cheaper and my toddler was free. As we came at the end time for the buffet staff went out of there way to accommodate and keep the buffet open, make fresh food and cooked to order eggs.  Most impressive was the outdoors! Beautiful scenery and so much fun to be had! It is a very unique park with different attractions then your average amusement park. Activities included zip lining, Ogo ball (a human sized hamster ball), horseback riding, mini golf, trampolines, hummer rides etc. Our family is not usually huge thrill seekers and have never tried most of these items. Staff were extremely accommodating to this and went out of their way to explain, help and make sure we safely had fun and enjoyed everything! We had next to no line ups while there and noticed the park supervisor regularly circulated to ensure all attractions were running smoothly and guests needs were being met.  Had the chance to communicate with the hotel manager Sean. It quickly became apparent to me how attentive he is as a manager to the resort and the guests needs. This attitude was apparent in all the staff as well. Staff went over and above to make guests happy. Staff continually greeted you, offered to take family pictures with my camera, hold doors etc. One park staff even offered sunscreen for my children's use as I had forgotten it in the room. Wow! Everybody was happy at the resort and seemed to like being at work.  This mini vacation was a breath of fresh air. We chose it to do something different as we regularly go to amusement parks, water parks etc. If you have taken your kids to amusement you know it is not uncommon to meet grumpy people, long lines, and have to do tons of walking in the heat leaving you tired and grumpy at the end of the day. This park was a totally different experience. Everyone was happy, the attractions were completely different than other parks and we left feeling relaxed and happy after spending the days in the beautiful scenery! My 11 year old loved all the new experiences and stated she has as much fun here as she did on the cruise we had taken earlier in the year (and Horseshoe was a fraction of the price!).  We will defiantly be returning to the resort. Everyone in the family had fun and as there is a big age difference in my kids that can sometimes be hard to achieve. Thank you Horseshoe for some unique experiences, wonderful memories and a great vacation!",5,positive

We had a package that had a room plus hotel credit and we took advantage at both Silks and the Crazy Horse Saloon. If you have kids, the Crazy Horse may be a better option. While the hotel was under renovation, service was still impeccable. We let them know that we were coming up to celebrate my daughter's birthday and they surprised her with a tray of sweets in the room. We spent 2 days at the Adventure Park. The staff were very hospitable to my girls and they got to enjoy all of the activities immensely. If you can catch the Wag Jag offer for unlimited use, take advantage, it is well worth it.",5,positive

My manicure was maybe 45 mins in length, no cuiticle treatment, no nail shaping or trimming. They then put 1 coat of nail polish on and sent me on my way...thats what I got for $45...outrageous. The rooms are mediocre at best..holes in the walls, half furnished rooms, decor from the 80's. No mini bar, no bottles of water and no coffee maker bare bones at its finest. Its like syline doesnt know how to operate a hotel!....they should check out the competion and see what they offer and what Horseshoe is missing.....its shocking! I am an SPG member and I am highly disappointed in the accomdations and service at horseshoe...would never recommended this resort to anyone....Carriage Ridge is around the corner check it out......or go to Blue Moutain they know what they are doing.",1,negative

Condo was spacious and clean although dated. Less than a 2 minute walk to the adventure park which kept 4 adults and 2 very active 8 year olds busy for the day. Lots to do for all ages: pools, spa, hiking, biking. We loved the zip-line. Scenery is fabulous and resort is well maintained and clean. Check in time of 4pm is too late. It would have been nice to be able to access our room earlier, especially since check out is 11am. We brought our own groceries and ate in. The condo has a fully equipped kitchen.

172130650,barrie/ca/154980/185603/172130650.html,Horseshoe Resort,"It was a last minute one night getaway. Unfortunately, the weather on day one limited our abilities to take part in the adventure park, but it looked pretty good. When I booked the room, the agent touted the newly decorated rooms. Our room was nice, and I do like the walk in shower. But I noticed that the floor of the shower and along the outside edge and the corners needed better cleaning. A room that is new should not be showing signs of needing cleaning already. A worse example of poor cleaning is the indoor pool, that has a terrible water line, that I could scrape with my fingernail, so they should be able to remove it. I note they are also putting in a new outdoor pool. I appreciate their efforts to bring new and added features, but they need to take better care of what they have first. The Crazy Horse restaurant is average, at best, but the breakfast buffet was quite good. Lastly, I think they could use better signage around the Inn and the property as we had a bit of trouble finding a couple things ie getting to the outdoor pool, Segway (and Treetop Trekking and ATVs both of which were fantastic).

When booking by phone the staff had no idea about deal, waited on hold 5 minutes. Finally received deal. No one told us resort was under construction. Made the deal really a no deal.  Rooms are tired and smell like smoke. Staff are very friendly, but cannot make up for the how run down this resort has become. Recommend you stay in Barrie and drive out to use the resorts attractions

Closet had more of the same concrete pillows in it. 3.Extremely loud air con unit sounds like a plane taking off. Better bring earplugs... 4.Noisey. You can hear people in room above using the washroom (not just the flush). You can hear voices clearly from other rooms. 5.Wall in bedroom had something splattered up it.Nasty. 6.T V had no hdtv channels. Picture is analog and very fuzzy. Apparantly its the same in all rooms. 7.Did not sleep a wink given all of the above. 8.Indoor pool has a grimey dirt line just above water level. Tiles on floor missing around dirty drains. Very dirty pool area. 9.Overpriced crazyhorse restaurant was another disapointment. Food was sub par. Stay away from the all you can eat ribs..trust me. 10. Adventure area was fun and kids loved it. It was not busy. If it was busy it would be painfull as lineups are very slow.,2,negative

The condos are in need of a serious make-over . Outdated and smelly.   Our suite at the hotel, on the other hand, was fresh, clean and contemporary in design. Just one thing...management may want to consider adding a convenience like a hair dryer and replacing a few missing drawers from the cabinet. Also a shame that the couch wasn't a pullout . But overall, a very comfortable stay at the hotel.  The staff was extremely accommodating and friendly. We really appreciated them - they were always pleasant, helpful and provided wonderful service. It was also nice that hotel guests were provided with complimentary freshly brewed coffee in the morning.",4,positive
173035622,barrie/ca/154980/185603/173035622.html,Horseshoe Resort,"I booked through Expedia for a one night weekend stay. We stayed at the Inn (not the condos) and thought it was a very nice renovation that they did on the room. The bathroom itself would rival any Hyatt hotel. Beds were comfy and the room was spacious. There was a roomy small fridge and a very nice hair dryer in the room. The only problem was the noise from the outside hallway. This isn't really the hotel's fault; just some very inconsiderate guests who thought talking and laughing out loud is appropriate at 11pm (and then again some time during the middle of the night.) Our kids loved the adventure park. Plenty of activities for them to do there, and there were no long lineups, thankfully. One of the things that frustrated us was that there was hardly any signage on the grounds. Even figuring out where to go for check-in was hard. Once we did check in, we asked the front desk employee how to get to the outdoor pool. She pointed and said ""walk straight out there and enter through the side."" She failed to mention which side (we tried both). We had to get one of the maids in the condo building to show us how to get there (you had to enter in through a door at the side, walk down some stairs to the basement, turn left, walk down a hallway, and then enter through the changerooms.) Also, they gave us a map with hiking trails on it, but none of the trails were marked with signage, so we had no idea where they were. Overall it was an okay place to stay, but I'm not sure if I'd go back there again. Might try some other resorts next time.",3,negative

I called to cancel and was informed that I would be charged the entire amount as I needed to cancel 7 days prior. I told the girl there policy was one nights deposit. She argued and insisted I would be charged even though I had an email clearly outlining their policy. At this point she backed down and said it would be ony throne night...an obvious attempt to rip me off. Bad enough the take the deposit bu to blatantly lie is not acceptable. Avoid this resort and any other skyline resorts!!!

The rooms are large and well appointed. My preference would be ask for a room in the main building, ideally on the 3rd floor facing west, so you will overlook the golf course and the hills beyond.  A fun thing to do at the resort is take a 1/2 day or day long course at the Yahama Riding School. There you are taught to ride Yahama dirt bikes and then are taken on trails through the surrounding Simcoe forest. There are rides suitable for all levels of experience. Even very young children can learn to ride. Its a blast ..... and safe.",4,positive

But when the nearest coffee shop is car ride away, this was annoying. The restaurant on site is ok, the prices seem fair. Now for the not so ok! The outdoor pool on site is being worked on, so I had to walk to the other building to use the outdoor pool. Walking through the run down condo building to get to the pool and when we arrived no towels and the pool it self was filled with leafs and other items. My two days there I've never seen no personnel walk through the pool area in my two night stay. **note** the Adventure park is closed on Monday's. My rating says it all, it's ok.",2,negative

We had a room with two queen beds and a lower level with enough space for a rollaway bed, seating and a fireplace (electric). The room was nice, beds comfortable and we loved the bathroom renovation. The staff at the resort was very friendly and helpful. The outdoor pool at the Inn was not open so we went over to the pool by the condo, but it was not very clean and we found it too cold. The indoor pool at the Inn was warmer but we found that it too could use a good cleaning. Wasn't cleaned at all during our two day stay. We had a good time in the adventure park - good for kids under 12, though my son (16) did play mini-golf with us. My husband and son enjoyed the Zip line and the Segway tour. We all did the Hummer tour - definitely the highlight of the trip - great fun! Hard to find a place that has activities that my teenaged son will enjoy as well as my younger daughter - the activities at Horseshoe fit the bill. I would recommend becoming a Skyliferewards member as it saved us quite a bit of money on the room. food and activities. It's free to sign up and worth it!",4,positive
174514715,barrie/ca/154980/185603/174514715.html,Horseshoe Resort,"We went on this hummer tour back in may with a family group, kids and grandmas alike, and it was really quite a hoot! Grandma sat in the front seat where the ride was not as rough and she was fine there, and most of us, including the kids, sat in the rear. We all had a blast!  Seeing as how I own my own off road toy I thought I might find this a bit like a lazy river, but I was thoroughly impressed with the capabilities of the old school hummer. It's impressive the hills that it can climb and the side hills it can traverse. At one point, we bypassed this steep hill, kinda hidden in the trees, I caught it out of the corner of my eye and thought it was a quad trail, didn't really think much of it. The next thing you know, we are backing up and I realized where we're going; to which someone said, OMG, we're not going down there are we! Of course we are! Haha! That was right around the time highway to hell came on the radio... epic!  I would recommend this tour to anyone and would definitely do it again myself.

174550830,barrie/ca/154980/185603/174550830.html,Horseshoe Resort,"We stayed in a two bedroom condo suite. The building itself looks like it's falling apart, complete with caution tape in areas. The elevators were out of order and apparently had been for weeks, although we did see repairmen working on them. We were offered porter service to help us take our luggage up the worn stairs, but the porters were gone and a petite housekeeper was sent instead. The decor in the suite is quite outdated. The single beds in the first bedroom were too small for my teens and there's certainly room for a queen or king bed in the master bedroom. The pillows were very hard and there was an actual layer of dust on the dresser that I could draw a line in. The ""fully equipped kitchen"" was lacking in pans to cook anything inside the oven. Our package included chicken and vegetables with instructions to sauté them, but there was only one pan of the appropriate size, so we had to saute the chicken first, then use that same pan to saute the vegetables after. There was also no guest information booklet in the room to let us know about the amenities and how to take advantage of them, such as the location and hours of the pools and towels. The indoor hot tub was out of service and the room was filled with supplies instead. Another frustration was the internet service. When we arrived, we were not able to connect to the internet. When I informed the front desk of the problem, I was told that the internet works best closer to the balcony due to the surrounding concrete, but we could not connect even while on the balcony. 24 hours later, the internet suddenly started working (although slow), so the concrete obviously wasn't the problem.  The reason for our visit was the adventure park. With the Ogo ball out of service, there is not a lot for teens, since mine were not interested in the mining and are too big for the Euro bungy. That left the maze, rock climbing, zip line (that we were allowed to do twice due to the Ogo closure) and mini golf. We left the mini golf for later in the day to avoid the crowds and heat, but were surprised to find that the lights are just for show, since they were not turned on, so we had to finish our round in the dark. So our visit was fine but not the quality one would expect from a ""resort"".",3,negative
174726877,barrie/ca/154980/185603/174726877.html,Horseshoe Resort,"We visited Horseshoe the weekend of August 24th 2013. The main building was nice with a clean lobby and helpful front desk attendants.The room itself was fine, clean and tidy, although there was a lack the useful information for people who are away from their homes that you can usually find in a hotel room, such as restaurant menus, things to do, etc. Also, there was only basic cable and no option for movie purchases which would have been nice in the late evening, but oh well. We did dine in the restaurants, both The Crazy Horse and Silk, and the food was great. We made use of the spa services as well, and they were very well done.   When we tried the indoor pool area, we noticed it was dated and looked grimy in spots, and the sauna was a warm summer day's temperature at best, so..not very hot at all! The huge gap under the door might be a cause of this. Very old. The boards on the bench looked about ready to collapse. Which was hugely disappointing for us as we love saunas, even dry saunas. We went to try the outdoor pool area, and the first thing we noticed was the state of the building (suite building?) which is a separate building from the main building. It was a wreck! Holes in the wall, torn carpet, dirt... neither of the saunas in the men's or ladies change rooms worked at all and the entire pool area was quite grimy. My husband even hit the emergency button because he thought it was the jet spa button, but no alarm sounded and no one came to the rescue! Safety issues...  So overall, we found that while the resort was ok if you don't ask for much. (Except for an empty wallet, as it costs TOO much to stay at a place of such low quality). We won't be going back and will go to a different resort next time to get some of the luxuries that we thought we has paid for that weekend. Not a major deal, but a bit of a bummer.

The condo was very spacious with separate bedrooms, 2 bathrooms, a pullout couch, and a full kitchen. They do need updating though. Quite worn and very different from the main hotel. The outdoor pool was quite buggy so we stuck with the indoor pool on day two. We all loved the zip line (but you must weigh 75lbs or more to enjoy this). Our youngest wasn't able to do the zip line and enjoyed mining for gems instead. The breakfast buffet was yummy, thought pricey. The people working on the main desk were lovely and very attentive.

Check-in was quick and friendly - I had told them beforehand that it was our anniversary and were quick to congratulate us upon arrival and pull some strings to get us last-minute dinner reservations at Silk - and a bottle of wine was waiting for us in our large room. We spent the afternoon walking around the resort, playing the fun mini-golf course, stopping for a caesar and a snack at the Crazy Horse, and shopping for some new golf attire at the clubhouse. Golf the next morning was amazing at their Highlands course, and we came home relaxed and happy.   Our only complaint was our experience at Silk. While waiting for our table, we asked the bartender at the lounge for a drink. She completely ignored us for 20 minutes (The affluent-looking foursome next to us was tipping her heavily so I understand why she wasn't willing to give her attention to anyone else) and once we finally got our drinks our table was ready. Once we received our meals I noticed that my steak was rare (I had asked for medium-well) and when the server came back with the steak that had been supposedly placed on the grill again, it was floating in a pool of blood on the same plate it went in on (I know this because she used my breadcrumb-filled side plate to transport the steak) , untouched. The server was apologetic, and reimbursed us for my meal. The best part of the meal was the sticky toffee pudding, which was awesome. My husband's dessert, the apple parcel, turned out to be a run-of-the-mill apple blossom.   Because of the great service we were given at the Hotel, we will definitely return to the Horseshoe, but will likely try our hand at another restaurant when it comes to dinner.",4,positive

The elevator, air conditioning didn't work and wifi was either slow or not working at all. There was a discussing smell in the foyer, stairwell and the room. One of the two chairs on the balcony was broken. Getting to the pool you are treated to dark and dirty hallways, ripped carpet and missing ceiling tiles. The pool is cold and dirty and used by a daycare in the afternoon so forget relaxing by the pool or in the room (windows have to be open because of the lack of AC). The pool by the main hotel was out of order.  The Dark Horse bar was also very dated and smelled, the beer overpriced and service slow.  The fine dining restaurant had a wonderful atmosphere but the service was unbelievably slow and the lobster festival entree was so bad I couldn't eat it so I eat by myself as my family watched. The salmon I had was good and I appreciated it being taken off the bill.  The adventure park is for small children so my teenage daughter had little to entertain her.  I complained about the condo as soon as I arrived and was told they would look at moving us to the main building, nobody contacted me. I complained again checking out and was again ignored. I filled out two surveys sent from the resort and one from the parent company and checked the box ""would you like to be contacted by one of our management team"" and was ignored. I sent an email to Jaunt.ca who I booked through, they contacted Horseshoe suggesting I be contacted and was still ignored.

The segway tour staff were the only bright spot!,Interestingly they are not actual hotel staff. During power outage absolutely While i know that the hotel can not control mother nature however a little compassion for hotel guests goes a long way. NO attempt was made by hotel and staff to help us, emergency lights were not on , had to get to room in dark halls, had to call husband in our room to come and open jammed hall door! that would have been a nice touch in a fire! a woman answering at front desk was hostile when asked if there was news of when power would be back on. I am from out of town and not only managed to talk to someone from hydro and find out power restoration time but they actually gave me a call on my cell to say power was back. We left @ 4 to drive into near by town for food, again it was as if we were invisable. Indoor pool had NO supervision or staff/life guard, after watching two adult males act dangerously with their small children my young daughter and I left, I didnt want to witness someones harm or worse death! YES IT WAS THAT DANGEROUS!! the two men having a foul language conversation while we tried out the hot tub was the straw that broke the camels back. again NO staff was present.

Upon booking I had asked for a specific room and did not receive that type, we were put on the third floor that was under construction!! There was actually a piece of paper with "" staff only"" scribbled on the hall doors leading to our room ( the doors that were jammed shut during the power outage!oh and my favorite part was the barking dog in our hall at 6a.m( not a service dog I will add) sadly the most annoying part is we were sent a email asking about our stay/ experience and I explained the terrible troubles we had and have never had any contact from hotel to at least apologize.

We looked around at several packages, specifically looking for ones that included a couples massage (neither of us have ever had a professional massage and thought this would be a great chance to get one) and included a whirlpool/jacuzzi tub. We happened upon the Play and Relax package at Horseshoe resort which included a room with fireplace and ""whirlpool tub"", included a couples massage, a bottle of champagne, dinner and buffet breakfast. Sounded perfect. We booked through the website and then once booked, I called the spa to make our massage appointment. We decided to make it for 3 pm on the Friday as it was an our long and check-in was at 4pm.  Our anniverasary came and we hit the road from Brampton and then received a phone call just after 1pm. It was the spa calling to confirm that we were coming to our massage. I said we were and she replied ""well your massage was for 1 and it is now 10 after."" I quickly corrected her and told her our massage was for 3. To which she replied that they were now fully booked for the weekend. I told her that was unacceptable and she said she'd look into it and call me back. An hour and a half later, she calls back and says that they can fit us in at 9:15 Saturday morning. So our one night away from the kids, when we would actually get a chance to sleep in, we now had to get up early the next morning. As the massage was one of the key reasons we came to this resort, we took the 9:15 appt as we didn't want to miss out.  As we had planned on being at the spa for 3 for our originally scheduled massage, we arrived around 2:45 and were hoping for an early check in. The resort lobby was pure chaos. People arriving for a wedding, many Georgian College students doing an amazing race type activity and the lady at the front desk was on the phone with what seemed like a staff member and then was trying on another phone and walkie talkie to get a hold of another staff member. We waited for 15 minutes before we were even addressed. Luckily we were able to check in early... however she was still very distracted with the staff members, trying to track someone down, she didn't make eye contact or even smile at us. She asked ""how many cards?"" I replied ""One will be fine."" and then she handed us 2. Good thing she was listening to me. She didn't give us any info about the resort, the adventure park, hiking trails, anything. We got the impression that she just wanted to get rid of us.  We get to our room and quickly realize that the ""whirlpool tub"" which we thought would have jets, was in fact just a big bath tub. And looking out our window to see the reception tent for the wedding. Normally we would've gone to the front desk to ask to be moved, but we were already so flustered with everything, we didn't want to have to go through that too. It's funny that you would think that they would've put someone that was going to the wedding in the room beside the reception tent... Later on this proved to be very loud. Good thing we liked the music. I could sing to it while lying in bed.  With our package stating that it included a bottle of champagne, we were waiting for it to arrive... it never did. We didn't really think that we needed to ask for it!!  We went to Silks Lounge for dinner and thank goodness it was amazing. Food and service were great.  Headed back to our room after dinner, by now it was pouring rain outside, and turned on the TV to see that with the rain the satelite was not working and we couldn't get anything on any channel. There wasn't even an option for movies. Luckily we had the blaring music from the reception outside our window that we could dance too. LOL.  Next morning, up early as we have our massage from 9:15 to 10:15 and breakfast ends at 10:30 and check out is 11. We decided to check out then before our massage. Checking out was almost the same as checking in. Wasn't as busy, but definitely not friendly. No one ever asked how our stay was, if we enjoyed ourselves...  After check out we headed to the spa for our massage. Our massages were ok. My husband enjoyed his more than I did. Some spots that weren't even bothering me were worked on for far too long and my tense shoulders were barely touched. My first impression of a professional massage was not good at all. As we are walking out of our massage the lady at the desk of the spa says ""Your package covered $100 towards your massage so you owe $70."" Knowing that it said that a couples massage was included in the package I argued with her. She then called down to the front desk to confirm. In her conversation with the front desk, we hear her say that the massages were done by esthecians not RMTs, so we cannot get it covered by our benefits. Never were we told that they would not be RMTs!! The front desk then tells her that the massages are not covered if it is not RMTs. I am surprised, but not totally shocked as I thought our package included champagne and a tub with jets... So because we were upset she gave us a 50% discount and then we paid $85. Immediately we went to the front desk to ask for a manager, to find out that there was no manager on duty until 2pm. The lady at the front desk realized that there was miscommunication between her and the lady at the spa and told us that in fact our massage was part of our package and that we could go back to the spa to get a refund on our $85.   It was now 10:45 and the buffet was supposed to end at 10:30... luckily there were still bits and pieces around enough for us to have a good breakfast. After breakfast we went to the spa to get a refund and then got out of that resort as fast as we could!!",1,negative

Based on the reviews, myself and wife booked a Valley view room in the main hotel complex. The room was excellent and I couldn't find fault with it. That said, check your emails before you go - I got inexplicably bumped off my original booking and was given a courtyard view - and so I had to call customer service to get back my original booking.   On the not so good we arrived on a Saturday and we went for a late afternoon stroll around the complex. It was drizzling rain slightly and the onsite coffee places and casual eating places were all shut/closed. It felt eerily reminiscent of some Stephen King novel where everyone has disappeared and the play areas were deserted. I can understand places shutting early but for everything to be closed is not something I could visualize at other better known resorts - thus I'm withholding one star from my overall assessment.   Both the Crazy Horse restaurant and the breakfast dining are to be recommended. Would I go again ? Probably but when the place is a lot more busy outside.",4,positive

I had a hotel room - some of my colleagues had suites - which were even nicer with soaker tubs and fireplaces. The property is very nice with LOTS of places to go for a walk. The Adventure Park looked like fun - didn't have time to check it out. The staff were very friendly.  I would recommend that this is a great place for families. The food was amazing - everything was tasty. It was pretty to be in the outside tent eating - they do lots of wedding there. The venue for a working meeting was more rustic although satisfactory.

Skyline Hotels has taken over management and done a number of upgrades including interior decoration, painting, tilework and so on. Staff were friendly as usual, and helpful with our grandson. The hotel is dog-friendly which meant a LOT to our son and daughter-in-law. My only concern was that the pillows are very thick. The front desk attendant suggested puncturing a plastic membrane in the pillow and squeezing some of the air out, which I thought was odd. Bring your own pillow if you have neck problems!

We registered, well in advance, through a website provided by the tournament coordinators. Families, including us, booked the suites without incident. Confirmation came through in the form of an email. We arrived to find that most of us were downgraded to the lowest possible type of room rather than the 2-bedroom suite. The room allotted to us only had 2 queen size beds and a small bar fridge. No coffee maker, mugs, hair dryer, bath tub, etc. I believe the last time I stayed in a room that basic was at a roadside motel in the 1980's. We saw the same thing happen to other teams who arrived with kids and food in tow. We were not offered compensation in ANY way. Not a price reduction, not a complimentary meal, etc. The staff even tried to charge us cancellation fees when we, and several others, cut our stay short a day. All they did was blame the booking and tournament people who generously provided a plethora of business that weekend. I had had high expectations of Horseshoe Valley Resort. On two occasions we stayed at Carriage Ridge and I fully expected the same quality of service and accommodations from Horseshoe. Completely opposite.

It was my mother's 80th birthday so it was special. The room was run down. However nice views and cozy. Night was a nightmare for the whole family, snow plows beeping all night long, none of us could sleep. Then the parking lot at 5 o'clock beeping even louder. Horrific experience. Finally when all the beeping was done, the neighbours beside us had a dog that barked excessively, their television was extremely loud. I called down to complain, and was told that they would call the room. Not sure if it was because the noise beside us never did quiet down. The only compensation we had was that we didn't have to pay for my bunny to stay (waived the pet fee); however for 6 people, two people being seniors (one who turned 80 that day) not to get any sleep didn't really feel compensated. Also when booking on-line, if you choose an option make sure to tell the front desk because choosing the option on-line means nothing.

My boyfriend had trouble with his bindings from his new board and the repair shop at the bottom of the slope was extremely helpful, they make adjustments on bindings for free (the staff made us feel at home and they were *not condescending at all- we had a problem at blue mountain last year from staff). It was quiet on the hills and when I had trouble with one of my ski's at the top they had staff all around the hills constantly to help.

We purchased 5×7 passes in the summer and had yet to process them (get our photos done). I had mentally prepared my day to be a long one; likely waiting in long line ups and being treated as just another number. This is our first time purchasing ski memberships. I was shocked and surprised by how quickly the line was serviced and our pass processor, Emily, was both friendly and efficient. When I asked about what was included with our passes, she quickly searched another kiosk to get me a brochure to take home, as well as explain what is were included in our new membership.  We went back to the truck to put on our equipment for their first run and sure enough my son's binding broke off. I didn't know what else to do, so I sent my three older children to the bunny hill to warm up and I took my youngest son to the rental shop to ask for help.  WOW! I was blown away. Brandon (Rental Area Staff) took a look at the ski and managed to tweak my son's binding and get him on the hill in 5 minutes flat. He was both friendly and very professional. He explained to me why it broke off and made several suggestions to fix it.  I met up with my kids on the bunny hill and although busy, the lift staff were on the ball, slowing down the chair for me and the boys to jump on.  On a side note we just returned the week previously from a 5 star resort in Cuba and didn't have one tenth the service while on vacation.

Check-in was 4pm- and there was a long line-up. Even those who had ""checked in"" earlier- were forced to return at 4pm to get their key. Nothing is worse than finishing a day of skiing, and standing in your ski boots in line for 45 minutes. They kept saying ""it's our busy season""- well they need to fix it. It was also a disastrous area to drop off your bags- only 1 main entrance and has not been well plowed and many cars blocking the area. We were forced to walk 10 minutes from our car with all of our ski gear. Not even CLOSE to ski in/ski out. The heater unit was ridiculously noisy. The pillows were HUGE blocks of cement. The bathroom is quite lovely with a stand up shower only- no baths. Not worth the money- a bitter disappointment to be honest. Not even a coffee maker in the room to make a coffee/tea/hot chocolate.

The conditions were pretty decent, considering the heavy rainfall on Saturday. The Nordic Trail system has to be one of the jewels of Horseshoe Valley. There is 40 km of skiing tracked for both classic and skate skiing. On the valley (south) side of the road, the trails offer great views across the summer-time golf fairways. They also loop through the hilly treed area behind the alpine ski operation. At the very top of the south side trail system is a great little trail that meanders through the rolling fields of an abandoned farm, but the real gem of the Nordic system is The Copeland Trail, found on the north side of Horseshoe Valley Road, This trail consists of the North section and West trail. These trails are great for skiers from beginner to expert. The Grand Allee on the West Trail offers a straight and gentle path into a beautiful forest wonderland. Take the North section, and you ski up and down through a wilderness that is faraway from the bustle of the city.  Trail passes are available on the Valley side of the street or via your smartphone. Nordic ski rentals are available at the Adventure Park. You can even book lessons! I suggest you park on the north side of Horseshoe Valley Road where the parking lot is less busy and you are closer to the amazing Copeland Trails and away from the alpine ski area. There is an unmanned warming chalet there with seating for picnic lunches and washroom facilities. If you are looking for more amenities and restaurants, park on the the south side. Check out the amazing trails, get outside and enjoy winter at Horseshoe Nordic. I’ll be back on the trails next weekend!",4,positive

They do not appear to care about customer satisfaction in my experiences. Our first year skiing with them, my oldest son suffered from a serious concussion during one of their supervised ski lessons- we picked him up from the lesson and drove directly to emergency. We never received one phone call from the resort to follow up on his condition(and yes- they were aware it was serious- he bumped his head, blacked out, and vomited afterwards). Needless to say, that was our last lesson, and we now keep our kids with us whilst skiing. On another occasion, I filed a complaint regarding service in their parking area. I had been refused parking at the resort due to an event, and forced to park across the highway with 2 toddlers on my own. That was an experience in itself- hiking a good km with 2 toddlers attempting to carry their own equipment across a highway. No assistance of any kind was offered- I never heard back from the resort. Finally- this past week, my son's skis were stolen. Very little assistance offered. They offered me rentals the night they were stolen- we declined as were upset, and still searching for the skis. No follow up phone call regarding my report- nothing. I spoke to customer service this week stating that my son's skis have not turned up, and that we are, despite much looking, still unable to find him a replacement pair- hence not using our passes at all. I requested rentals as we did not accept the offer the night they went missing. The response was ""too bad- you declined that night- that was your choice"" and ""skis are stolen all the time- this is the best we can do"". Not apologetic- not helpful-quite rude actually. They offered us 10% off rentals as a compensation(big deal -a couple of bucks off 32.00 rentals when we are already out a couple of hundred-still profit for them, profiting off of a bad situation for a customer). It would not take much to help appease a customer in this situation- a simple follow up phone call-""we are sorry about your situation, we can help you by...providing a day of rentals, etc"" It would cost them nothing, and help make a bad situation better.

The bed was like sleeping on a cloud and the sitting area with the fireplace was a nice touch. The bathroom was amazing, the tub was huge and the shower was great. We ate dinner and breakfast at the Silks restaurant; if you ever get the chance to go there have the lamb it was out of this world. The food was beyond amazing, perfectly cooked and absolutely delicious. The breakfast was also well done, the food was all hot and delicious, a great start to the day. We spent the two days skiing. The hills as usual were well taken groomed and not too crammed. My binding popped off at some point and when we took it to the ski shop they fixed it without charge and really quick. Our only down points was the pricing. The hotel was overly priced for what it was, just a simple hotel. The food was very expensive (for dinner I could understand but not for breakfast). And the service we got was not very good. The receptionist when we came in was very unpleasant and was working as fast as she could to get us done when there wasnt a line up (we were the only ones checking in at the time), she didnt even smile once even when we tried joking with her. The service from our waiters was also poor. Although our dinner server was very nice she never came by once to check on our meals, our drinks were always empty and we had to keep on asking other servers to fill them; we saw her check up on other tables around us multiple times before she came back to us. This also happened with our breakfast server but was ten times worse, she gave us very small glasses when we asked for our drinks and didnt come by to refill them once, when we were finished our meal we waited 10 minutes before we had to finally go and get the server to pay for our meal, during our meal she passed our table several times without a glance to go check on other tables and refill their drinks, we were very confused why we got this treatment and were very surprised as we always make sure we are very pleasant to our servers. The only other problem was that there are not enough lifts at the resort, we waited sometimes 10-15 minutes to get onto a lift. It was unbelievable. We spent more time standing at the bottom of the hill than on the actual hills. Our room was wonderful besides the fireplace, which we were really hoping for because we were freezing after 8 hours of skiing, it hardly worked! Never dried or warmed our clothes at all, really disappointed with that. None-the-less, we enjoyed our time very much together.

I could have used another outlet at the desk for my computer and cell phone, I had to unplug the lamp, but I guess this is not a place for work. I had an amazing dinner in the dining room. Locally grown fare meticulously prepared and served by very friendly staff. I also enjoyed a very affordable french Pinot Gris off an extensive wine list. All in all it was a great experience, I will return with my family soon.",5,positive

192503108,barrie/ca/154980/185603/192503108.html,Horseshoe Resort,Stayed in one of upgraded rooms. room 135 which was very nice but has a draft in lower area. Was told this is same in all deluxe rooms which is too bad. Fireplace offers little help. Room was very nice and very clean. Rooms need more outlets for phone and iPad charging. Would agree with others that front desk staff do very min job requirements and don't make you feel very welcome. Housekeeping staff were very friendly. Lobby/bar and pool area are in need of update. Indoor outdoor pool with outdoor hot tubs would get this hotel into the modern day and offer what most other ski resorts offer. Friends stayed in 2 bedroom condos which are very dated and had paint peeling and rips in furniture but for the price they are good value if you have family with you. Was told these units are to be upgraded soon.   We had dinner first night at silks service was so slow and food was cold when it came 60 min after we had our appetizers . We discussed this with executive chef who told us to go back next night and offered us a discount. Second dinner was so good and service was like a five staff experience that it was had to believe it was same Resturant. Need to go one more time to see what is the usual experience.   Front desk staff need to a better job explaining what there is to do on property.,3,negative

The location is great, 50 Meters from the ski lifts. The Suite was large, the furniture average. The fireplace was artificial, no real fire, no gas fire, no warmth.

193389371,barrie/ca/154980/185603/193389371.html,Horseshoe Resort,"We stayed at Horseshoe Inn during the week for a ski trip with friends and had a lovely time. Although I had a lot of frustration at the beginning during my reservation process, way before we got to the hotel.   Horseshoe is part of a group of hotels owned by Skyline Hotels and Resorts. When you make your reservation it is Skyline that you deal with. Originally I was speaking with Skyline reservation agent on the phone to decide what package to choose for my stay. We ended up deciding that an early bird package that included your hotel stay, Lift tickets, and breakfast would be the right package for me. I was excited and looking forward to my trip, we even decided to bring the family cat along.   A few days before our arrival I called Skyline back to confirm and ask a few questions. I found out that breakfast would not be included in our package. I was a little taken back by this surprise, seeing as I spoke with a reservation agent that told me breakfast would be included. I ended up speaking to the manager of reservations at Skyline. She told me that she would wave my pet fee ($25.00) but could do nothing else until she looked into the matter further. I waited a few days and I never received a call back. I called the day before we were set to arrive at Horseshoe and spoke again with a reservation agent. She looked up my file and said that her manager concluded her investigation and could do nothing more to assist me. When I asked why I did not receive a call back when the manager concluded her investigation she replied ""I am not in the position to tell my manager what to do"" I also inquired about the policy for early check in, because I was bringing our cat I couldn't just leave her in the car while we went to ski on the hills. I was told to call Horseshoe front desk in the morning and let them know that I wished to check in early and they would be able to give me a time that my room would be ready before traveling all the way there.   I called Horseshoe front desk the morning we were to arrive. They told me that what Skyline told me is incorrect, and that they can not guarantee early check in. To request early check in you physically had to be at the resort, and even then it was not guaranteed.   At this point I was beyond disappointed, even before stepping foot in the resort. I had never had this much difficulty trying to arrange a stay with any of the other resorts I have stayed. We decided to take the risk and ended up arriving at the resort at approximately 1pm.   Once we arrived at Horseshoe my whole mentality changed. We were greeted by very friendly and helpful staff, and they had no problem checking us in. The room was nice and clean and of good size. The beds and pillows were so comfy!! One thing I would note is that our fridge ended up being to cold and froze or beverages. Once we got settled we took a walk around the Inn to see what we could find. We went into the gift shop and met this lovely older gentlemen who told us all about the resort and what we could do. I have read a few complaints about customer service on here, and I am honestly surprised. Everyone we met was friendly and accommodating, from reception and wait staff to the cleaners we were always met with a smile.  We stayed at Horseshoe for 3 days (During the week) and we did a lot of skiing! The hills are fantastic! You couldn't get board with the amount of runs they have. I defiantly recommend going during the week because you feel like you have the mountain to yourself. Also a great place for families or novice skiers.   The Crazy Horse restaurant was fantastic! We tried Fish & Chips, Chicken Fingers, Steak, and Chicken wings all were mouthwatering delicious! The wait staff were also friendly.  We had breakfast as a buffet style and a la carte. I have seen bigger buffets but it was fairly decent. I enjoyed a la carte better because the food was warmer, but that is usually the case with any place you go. The Orange juice I had wasn't the greatest, tasted more like orange drink powder. I did enjoy the fire place in the lobby, it gave off the lovely smell of campfire and gave a cozy lodge feeling.  The pool area was clean and a good size with a large hot tub spa. It was nice to relax in after a day on the slopes. I do want to note that one time we were in there some ladies accidentally pushed the emergency stop for the hot tub and set off the alarm. No staff came running in to see if there was an issue and double check if everyone was ok, I thought it was a bit odd.  Going into the trip I thought that this would be my first and last time at Horseshoe, but after staying at the resort I rely enjoyed myself and would consider going back. If it wasn't for my frustration with Skyline to begin with, I would have given this resort a higher rating. I would strongly recommend that if you have any questions regarding your stay that you speak with the reception desk at Horseshoe its self and NOT Skyline reservations.",3,negative
194514671,barrie/ca/154980/185603/194514671.html,Horseshoe Resort,"I have been visiting Horseshoe Resort regularly for the last 4 years as i have 2 young children. I typically ski there about 7 days a year. The kids Korral is great for young kids. The new extended magic carpet is a nice addition this season.  Unfortunately Horseshoe does not understand customer service. You will see many complaints about their customer service throughout the reviews here and my complaint is yet another example.  This past family day weekend Horseshoe resort was completely unprepared for any potential crowds. They treated the weekend like any other weekend. While crowds built on Saturday and Sunday, no effort was made to prepare for the ultimate disaster that transpired on the holiday Monday.  My first complaint began earlier in the weekend when the quad chair we were using began loading every second chair. I have never seen this happen at any resort before. The reasoning according to the attendant, weight restrictions? I have never heard anything so absurd.   My second complaint is with regards to organization of crowds. Virtually no effort was made to coordinate the lines. When an attendant was present, they were extremely lax and more interested in doing anything but what they were supposed to do which is coordinating people to ensure that the chairs are full. Instead they were talking with friends and numerous chairs were going up with singles during peak times! Imagine seeing every second chair full and then seeing singles on a quad chair. Completely insane.  My final complaint is the disaster that ensued on the holiday monday. While the lines just to get a lift ticket were almost unbearable on Sunday (clue in, its super busy Horseshoe call in as many staff as possible), the lines were totally out of control on Monday. How bad you might ask? I waited over 1 hour in -20 degrees C outside just to get lift tickets for me an my family at 9:30 a.m. But wait it gets better. There was only 1 ticket window open outside at the EXPRESS LINE. That is correct ONE TICKET WINDOW! I could not believe the audacity. I had pre-purchased my lift tickets. When Horseshoe realized how bad the problem was they shut down the customer service window. Perhaps they were reallocating staff to address the ticketing problem? Who knows?  After about 45 minutes in the ticketing line up, a representative began walking the line and asking who had pre-purchased. I immediately put up my hand. When approached by the staff member she explained that she could not validate my e-ticket and therefore i would need to wait.  And so I waited, and waited some more. I finally made it to the front of the line after 1 hour and 10 minutes only to find out that they were not even validating the etickets and just writing them down on a piece of paper. Ugh.  I then proceeded to negotiate with the representative explaining that the line up outside was intended to be the ;Express' line up and that i was waiting for over 1 hour. The response""It's not our fault!"" Clearly I wouldn't have been so upset if it weren't for the fact that the resort is claiming that it is not their fault and yet they only have ONE TICKET WINDOW open on what was likely to be one of their busiest days of the year!  Trust me I don't ask for a lot. Perhaps, something like this ,""I am sorry, we appreciate your patience we weren't expecting this type of line up and we were a little unprepared with only 1 ticket window"" would have been appropriate rather than ""It's not our fault"" Perhaps some kind of gesture would have been appropriate? Oh I don't know, why not offer people a free hot chocolate? Its not like it costs more than .10 cents a cup. Or perhaps offer a small discount on the lift ticket. Nothing extreme but something to suggest that Horseshoe resort appreciates their customers patronage. Nope, Nothing, Zip. Zilch! ""Its not their fault~""  I am a regular visitor of Carriage ridge resort and like the proximity of the resort to Horsehoe however now that they are offering discounts to Moonstone I think that I may be inclined to take the family to somewhere other than Horseshoe.",1,negative

194723921,barrie/ca/154980/185603/194723921.html,Horseshoe Resort,"My family and I stayed at Horseshoe Resort for 2 of our last 4 christmas holidays as my kids like to ski. During the first trip, 4 years ago, my son, daughter and nephew were registered in beginner ski/snowboard lessons (ages 10 to 13). Within one hour of the lesson, I was called to be informed that my son fell and appeared to have broken his arm. Not being from the area, I left in a panic with my son who was visibly in alot of pain to find the Orillia hospital. We spent the entire day at the hospital and my son ended up in a cast for a broken arm. Obviously this ruined the day of not only myself and my son, but the other kids as well. We left early the next morning because he was in such pain. I called the resort later that week to see if they could offer us another ski day/lesson and they apologized but said here was nothing they could do.   We decided to give the resort another chance two years later. We booked a week in one of the suites. Although it was convenient to have the suite with laundry and cooking facilities, the entire building was a little run down and not all that clean. The kids were able to ski/snowboard but I did not leave them to take lessons as I was worried about them, which meant I was with them the entire time on the hills and didn't get the break I was looking for. We left on New Years Yve and unfortunately forgot several boots, ski pants, hats, mitts and a sleeping bag in the closet. When I realized what I had done, the next day I called the resort and was told that because it was holiday that the cleaning staff had left and there was noone to check but that someone would call me back. The next day I received a telephone message from Susan from the Lodges in housekeeping saying that they have the stuff and that if I called back and left my address they would ship the stuff to me. I called back the next day and spoke to the manager and told him that I would be heading to Barrie the following weekend to pick the stuff up as I felt bad that because there was so much stuff and the cost to ship would be huge. We drove 4 hours each way to get the stuff and was told they did not have it. The girl at the front desk checked their log book which showed that the stuff was in housekeeping but they could not find it. I was very frustrated and left my contact information to have the stuff shipped to me. I received a call from Jessica a couple of days later saying that Susan was no longer with them and that the stuff was not there. I spoke to the manager and was told that they could not do anything about it. (Just in case anyone at Horseshow disputes that I left the stuff there or that it was found, I still have the message on my answering machine)  Needless to say I am incredibly dissapointed in my stays at Horeshoe Resort.",2,negative
194751222,barrie/ca/154980/185603/194751222.html,Horseshoe Resort,"We have been going for the annual moonlight cross country skiing for several years. The quality of the experience was significantly degraded this year for the following reasons:  1. No fire and hot drinks at the Junction Point. The camp-fire in the middle of the trails was the main attraction and managements decision to remove it this year it very disappointing. Needless to say staff did not inform us about this change and we were very disappointed to find this out when we got to the middle of the trail.  2. Very poor trail lighting. In past years the trails were adequately lit using lanterns. This year there was about 3-5 lanterns along the trails. Again, felt very inadequate.   3. Rude staff. We were gathered by the fireplace near the rental house at the end of skiing and staff refused to server us hot drinks which we were lead to believe were included in the price of the activity. When inquired they simply said they 'ran out' and refused to provide any substitutes.  Also, when the event finished staff just started throwing snow and putting out the fire in very close proximity to where we were standing such that hot coals recoiled on one of our group. The staff member did not inform us that we should leave but just started throwing in snow into the fire.  Overall, I urge management to considerer the above points for the next run of this event.",2,negative

We were fortunate to be able to check in early and received a beautifully renovated room with a fireplace. Although the fireplace was more for appearance and didn't seem to dry out our snowboarding gear, it was nice to look at.   Food:  We ate lunch at the Crazy horse, and had to wait to be seated for about 20 minutes even though there were plenty of free tables. The hostess seemed very overwhelmed and I am guessing they were short severs...which seems odd for a weekend. Food was tasty and delivered in a timely manner.  At around 845pm we headed to the Silks and was told they were closing early and that we would have to order in 2 minutes if we wanted to eat.   We went to the front desk to inquire about where we could buy some bottled water, and was told everything was closed. The little store in the main lobby closed very early.   We asked if there was a map of the resort, and what was provided was such poor quality it was useless. It would be nice to have known where all these dining options were, and other attractions, as we only found the hills, pools, silks and crazy horse.  Also, I guess they were trying to push timeshares, so upon arrival be prepared for someone to try and convince you to go to the time share meeting.   Overall we had a nice stay, the keurigs in the rooms were a nice touch. This resorts has a lot of potential but could use some minor changes.",4,positive

The hotel rooms are very dated and the heater sounds like an F1 tornado each time it turns on so don't expect a good night's sleep. Unfortunately all there is to do here is sleep once you're past 9/10pm. The restaurants all close by 10pm (Silks closes at 9) and even the pool closes at 10pm. There is no room service or any kind of gift shop to buy snacks so if you don't pack a cooler of food you won't be able to eat anything until the morning. For anyone hoping for a fun trip away there really is nothing to do once the ski lifts are closed so you might as well just come for the day and save your money.

I will start by saying that I hosted a group there for a 3-day seminar and while my conference services manager was really fantastic and went over and above the call of duty for me, many other things were sorely lacking. There was no phone in or around the meeting room and no way to contact anyone for support - I had to either walk to the front desk where they would radio someone (which was in a separate building) or use my own cell phone to call the front desk. I did not find that the staff was always very professional - perhaps because it was a ski resort geared toward a different audience - but it taught me that this is not the place for business meetings. The heat in the meeting room was never at a decent temperature (almost always too cold) and getting it working seemed to be a big fiasco.

However, the one major drawback, and the reason I won;t go back for an overnight stay, was the complete inconvenience of the hotel location in relation to the hill. In order to get from the hotel to the slope I had to carry the equipment through the parking, across the road and down a flight of very slippery, steep steps. There is no facility for hotel guests to leave skis at the hill, unless I had wanted to pay for a locker. Also, I was only told about this option at checkout. When I inquired about it at check IN, I was told there was a place in the hotel but to just take them to my room. The path to the road was very uneven and extremely hard to walk in in ski boots.

First time we've gone away skiing as a family with our 2 kids (14 and 11) even though my husband and I have been away skiing to Vermont and Ellicottville before kids.   Overall we enjoyed our stay immensely. All the staff were very friendly, helpful and hard working. Breakfast at Silks is good value and service is excellent. Ate dinner at Crazy Horse each night. Service was excellent and food was very good. First night my husband ordered ribs that were tough and awful. He complained to waiter who immediately offered anything else off the menu. He guaranteed that this serving was an anomaly and that another serving would be ""fall off the bone"". They were right. The 2nd batch was delicious and the mgmt also adjusted our bill accordingly for the inconvenience.   Our room had been updated and very spacious with a beautiful bathroom. Only complaints are: - no place in the room to store all our skis, boots and pools. We've stayed at Blue Mountain for non-ski getaways and their newer rooms have special closets for skis with shelves and hanging space - only 4 hangers which made hanging damp ski jackets and pants and other jackets a challenge - no other hooks to hang other ski clothes. In fact, they need to add more hooks or a towel bar in the bathroom. Nowhere to hang towels after the 4 of us finished showering.  This is a great family resort and there were a variety of runs for everyone including my husband and kids who are strong skiers, and me (a beginner). I took a lesson the first day which I found was a great refresher for someone who was an intermediate skier 20 yrs ago but who hadn't skied in 17 years.

If we didn't feel the need to try new hills all the time, we would definitely go back. Great value for what we got and would highly recommend Horseshoe to other families looking to get away close to home in the winter.

They could use staff at the lift lineups. Food prices in the cafeteria are what I expect for ski hills. Staff in the cafeteria knew what we should stay away from to order with food allergies. We booked on the ski/breakfast incl pckg. Brfst was in Silks, good variety on the buffet, hot and cold, lots of healthier options, and staff was great. Again, great with the allergies and even made something in the kitchen for us that wasn't safe on the buffet. We would go again but will stay away from holidays.",3,negative
198641272,barrie/ca/154980/185603/198641272.html,Horseshoe Resort,"We had a good time out of the city at this quiet and fresh snow fall covered resort, however upon my second visit to this resort I was far from impressed.  Upon arrival we were happy to hear that our room was ready early. However key programing systems were down and we waited almost two hours for our keys to be delivered to our room, to then find out that the hill closes at 4:30pm!!! What a waste of an afternoon! Had we known we would not have sat around waiting and twiddling our thumbs.  It would have been nice to know this upon check-in, or even better, before booking! After all, it is a ski resort! What do they think people want to do? Sit in the room and watch tv?? NO THANKS!  Also - the key problem continued... our room was situated at the very end of the building on the third floor; a good 5-10 minutes from the concierge desk when factoring in the elevator wait times and the walk down the long hallway. With no emergency or courtesy phones in the hall ways, we had to walk down to concierge THREE times..yes that's right.. THREE TIMES to have our keys programed because they were not working. We had even asked for a neighbouring room to call down to front desk for us so they could come up and let us in, to be told that they can not come to the room, and for us to go back down AGAIN!  We were in our bathing suits and towels, soaking wet, and cold, sitting in the hall way for over half an hour waiting for keys to be reprogrammed, while one person went down to the front desk three times.  With the hills closed, the pool crowded, we decided to watch a little tv in the room before going to diner at the Crazy Horse Restaurant and Bar to find that the quality of the cable connection was so poor that we couldn't even make out the hockey puck while attempting to watch the leafs game on the tv. TIME TO UPGRADE!!  Needless to say, although the resort is clean and well maintained - it needs updating, and much more communication as far as customer service is concerned.  Lighting in the rooms needs to be upgraded as well, it is horrible for women who are trying to do their makeup for a night out in town. Way too dark in the bathrooms, and the hall way/foyer.

After finishing up the season this year I won't I will renewing next season. - Inconsiderate resort staff have verbally abused me after I confronted them on blatant discourteous acts. Off-duty resort staff, wearing resort uniform, pushed me an my family while jumping the cue, while waiting in line for the lifts, causing my 4-year old son to fall over. I raised my concerns to senior management, by registered mail, that went unanswered. - ski patrol on several occasions nearly ran over my son with their snowmobiles, both on the slopes and in the parking lot. - patrons of this resort are either unskilled and dangerous on the slopes, or are very aggressive and don't respect the rules and conventions of the slopes, as mentioned above, including the resort staff.  - lifts are slow, unmaintained and antiquated. For several weeks one of their fast lifts was only working at 1/4 capacity - only allowing people to board every second chair and the speed was reduced. - trails were not groomed as frequently as I would expect. - I put my son in lessons at the kids coral ski school. Paid for a 1 hour lesson only to see they had less than 15 minutes on the slopes with their instructor - they spent the other 45 mins inside for whatever reason. We, and many irate parents demanded a refund which we did obtain. - Restaurant service is slow and inefficient. Some wait staff are inattentive. If it is busy don't expect even the most basic service levels. Food is decent however, when you get it.  I have spoken to shift supervisors throughout the season on the above and other concerns I won't mention here, with a standard response ""It is hard to get good quality people to work here"" and that there is a problem with the screening of applicants.  If you are coming this way to ski, I highly recommend going somewhere else, such as Moonstone or Blue.",2,negative

But...looking closer they sure did cheap out! The new caulking was cracking, partially missing and/or applied by amateurs. The stucco ceilings were just done. None of the old fixtures removed, stuccoed over. Trim missing, etc. Anyways, you get the idea. The experience overall was average. The food at the wedding was quite good I must admit.

Everything tasted like garlic and overwhelmed butter flavour. Staff at the restaurant looked like ""run-down"" people trying (or I would say, mimicing) to be upscale waiters. Guests would go dining there with track pants on! You could here neighbours doors open shut all night long. Staff's uniform was very ugly - Hawaiian Aloha shirt.

I immediately called the front desk and after waiting over a minute for someone to answer we were told they would send a maintenance over to check it out. I ran upstairs to the 5th floor, saw the construction and all the men there said it wasn't them and that the fire was on the third floor. Ran to the third floor to find the 10 men on the patio drinking and laughing because they caught something on fire but told me it was okay. No return call from the front desk or follow up.

The building was located right beside the outdoor pool. The resort itself is nice and has beautiful views of nature, however the building we were in looked like it was from the 1980's - a lot of brown everywhere. The kitchen had dishes and cutlery we could use, but we never ended up cooking. The bathroom had very little toiletries, just soap, shampoo and conditioner...the bare minimum. We didn't spend much time there as we checked-in, headed out for dinner then came home to sleep. The next morning it was raining and we could have just lounged around, but because the room was so drab and not inviting, we got out of there as quickly as we could. There was no breakfast included in the cost of the room ($320 for the night) and it was pretty expensive at $17pp without an omelette bar. Needless to say, we drove 25mins down HWY 400 to Cora's and got a phenomenal breakfast. All and all, okay place. It did the job because we got a good nights sleep.

Travelling with my husband, and two children (under 11) our destination was the adventure park. We had driven there last year for a day (drove in an out) and this year we wanted to add the nights stay. Upon our arrival we learned that it was the ""Warrior Dash"" weekend and thousands of people were on site to do it. Our shoulders were heavy when we drove past the police at the entrance directing traffic. We were SO EXCITED to find parking, several spaces available right up close to the resort. The adventure park was not very busy at all and the kid's didn't even have to wait in line for any of the programs. We each ziplined twice and there was only 4-5 people ahead of us each time. I am still in awe how we didn't have to wait for anything despite the sheer volume of people on site. In the adventure park the staff were great to the children.There is a magic show to entertain them several times a day, each show was different. We played mini golf. When we checked into our room at 5 the front desk staff were very quick and provided all kinds of information about the hotel amenities. With such a large property a lot can be missed. Our room was clean, minimally appointed. A little bit of dust on the flat table tops, room might not have been used in a week?? Didn't bother me one bit. At first I was surprised, disappointed no bathtub, but then in hind sight, we were never in our room long enough to use anyway. We left to go have a good dinner in Crazy Horse, (again no line up- we were shocked). For breakfast we enjoyed their buffet at Silks. We were so busy we didn't even get into the pool (which is why we stay in hotels). We did pass by them. The one smaller outdoor didn't look like it was in service but the larger one certainly looked nice and the indoor appeared nice too.

The spa price seems a little high at first but when you factor in the cleanliness, knowledge of medical aspects , service and the quality nail file and foot file you are given the cost is not out of line. The hotel is only 35 minutes away from Casino Rama and is a huge upgrade from most of the motels and hotels in Orilla.

A few weeks before our stay, when we read some of the negative reviews about these rooms on this very website, we asked the resort if we could be lodged in one of the renovated condo suites in the same building, only to be told that we would need to pay $60 to guarantee what the resort called an ""upgrade"". We took our chances but were not provided a renovated room.  As a result, we were very disappointed with our accommodations. While the condo we stayed in was spacious, it was in serious need of updating. The room smelled musty, even hours after opening the patio doors and windows. There were obvious repairs and clean-ups needed throughout the condo. Further, we were told upon check-in that there would be no housekeeping service in our building during our stay (no garbage removal, no replenishing of fresh towels, no maid service, etc.) Having said that, we enjoyed our time in the resort's Adventure Park, but wish it opened much earlier than 11 a.m. There were countless families waiting to take part in the park's activities, which resulted in a crush of people in the Tack Shop when it finally opened. Lunch at Crazy Horse was delicious and service was attentive. We never did use the Shizen Spa, as we were never issued the $35 credit that was part of our WagJag package.

Rooms were nice.First thing to know there are lots of great activities. Mini putt, climbing wall, Ogo ball (you only get 1 roll down the hill additional rolls are $7-SERIOUSLY) and ziplining plus other minor activities. Second to know, they don't open until 11AM and they close at 5PM. Short hours to get it all in and a late start for kids who are excited. Third to know, when you book only one night, you are only able to use the activities on ONE of those days. Important to know!! Another major issue was lack of knowledge. It seemed everyone we asked a question of, had a different answer. Lots of conflicting answers even from staff who were standing right next to each other. Very unprofessional, especially in a service industry. We wanted to do the The Tree Top Trekking. The hotel heavily advertises it on the website and with posters inside the hotel. When we checked in, our ""service representative"" told us we could book it through her. We came back approx an hour later and asked to do so and a different front desk girl told us that ""They"" have nothing to do with us you'll have to walk over and find out for yourself! We did just that and found they were much friendlier than the hotel staff. They didn't say much but there is clearly some sort of power struggle going on between the resort and the Trekking. For kids of a similar age, I would stay somewhere else as no breakfast was included and on site restaurants were expensive. If you stay at the hotel, get all of the details in an email prior to going as there is far too much contradicting going on at their desks. Definitely do the Tree Top Trekking.

It's a great place to turn the kids loose without worrying about their safety. It has everything the kids love, including indoor and outdoor pools and the Adventure Park. The rooms have been recently renovated and in general are decent, but this resort does not excel at the details. The air conditioning worked poorly - we had to have a fan brought in to cool the room down. But the in-room fridge kept the beverages nicely chilled. The food at the Crazy Horse is mediocre at best. Beyond the burgers there isn't anything I could recommend. And the prices are steep - there is no restaurant alternative within a 20 minute drive and the prices reflect this.

The park opens at 11:00 and closes at 6:00, so when we bought our tickets at 1:00 felt we had to race through the park to use up the pass because it would not be good the following day. My 6 and 4 year old quickly got exhausted and we did not get to use some of the attractions on the pass. Would have been nice to use the following day when the park opened to make up for the late start. As for the condo. It was great for our family! Lots of room and we got lots of use out of the kitchen. Only complaint is that the room is a bit dated, could use a make over! I was in a wedding on the Saturday and booked a full mani/pedi at 9am the day of the wedding. When I arrived for my appointment, I was not in the system despite my e-mail confirmation. They apologized and got me in for 10:00 for a quick color job as my nails were naked! When I finished they offered me a full treatment the next day, but when I told them I would not be able to use it as we had to pack up the room, and head to the wedding brunch for 11:ooam. With that being said, I still had to pay for my color treatment with no extra thought about my missed relaxation time away from the family, of which, I was truly looking forward to!

219793013,barrie/ca/154980/185603/219793013.html,Horseshoe Resort,"My 4 children and I recently stayed at Horseshoe Resort for a night, and we had Adventure passes to use the next day, which I will review separately. The hotel was located very conveniently next to the Adventure park, so it is a very small walk to the park for activities.  The hotel room was clean, and the beds were comfortable. The bathroom was large, with a nice, bright, roomy shower.  The room had a small fridge, which was nice. I do wish there had been a mirror outside the bathroom to make it easier for several people to get ready in the morning.  The disappointment really came in the pool area. Because the adventure passes all have to be used the same day, on the day of arrival we didn't feel we had enough time to maximize the passes, so we figured we would enjoy the hotel and pool and use the passes when the park opened the next day. Well, the indoor pool was so cold that none of us enjoyed using it. There is an outdoor pool, which was warmer, but the inside of the pool was so old, when sitting on the step you could feel all the peeling paint that was coming off in sheets. There was even paint that had been peeled off and set on the side of the pool. Also, there were staff painting the wood fencing around the pool with what I assume was an oil based paint, and the smell was nauseating. None of us could stand being in the pool for that reason, and it probably explained why no one else was out there. So unfortunately we ended driving all the way back to Barrie for something to do, returning to the hotel after dinner. I feel for the price some updating needs to happen....",3,negative
219883588,barrie/ca/154980/185603/219883588.html,Horseshoe Resort,"Knowing how dog owners often put their pet’s interests ahead of their own creature comforts I will start with Bentley’s rating which was a 5 tail wag, his top box rating.   How so ?  Our room #114 was on the ground floor very close to an exit door leading out to a grassy knoll above a golf green. This meant we could use it quickly and quietly when nature called to Bentley in the middle of the night.  Another contributing factor was the Hotel’s doggie welcome kit complete with a letter from the Hotel’s top dog, a roll of poop bags, some lovely dog treats and a very amusing door hanger advising staff that there was a doggie guest in the room. A brilliantly conceived piece !   Another unexpected bonus was the acceptance of dogs on the patio level of the Crazy Horse restaurant. This was a real bonus being able to have our meals with Bentley, a welcome change from the usual practice of a carry out meal eaten in one’s Hotel Room  And perhaps the best of all was the attitude of the reception staff. They invariably came out from behind their counter to pet him on our way in and way out of the Hotel during our 2 day stay saying lots of nice things to him and about him.   Maybe that is because he is an English bulldog………….. !   ‘nuff said !   So how did his Master and Mistress fare.  By all accounts very well in the end but not at the outset when we read the Trip Advisor reviews which made us a little uneasy about the rooms.  We eventually realized that there are two separate buildings  Make sure that when reading Trip Advisor Reviews for Horseshoe you make the differentiation between the Main Lodge reviews and the Condo reviews. From what we read the Condo units are pretty tired whereas the Main Lodge rooms are by contrast extremely nice having been recently completely renovated to a very high standard.   Room 114 is in the Main Lodge. It is a large room on two levels with a separate seating area a couple of steps down from the bedroom. The tub is huge and the shower stall of similar size.   All in all a very enjoyable stay.",4,positive

My wife thought it would be a good idea to wind down with some physical outdoor activities and chose the Resort. She was right in every respect and the Horseshoe Resort was a great choice. Tree Top Trekking, 2000 ft zip line, ATV's and an amazing Hummer drive through tracks and trails in the forest meant we were all worn out each night. The Inn at the Resort provided good basic accommodation and although food choices were somewhat restricted to the Crazy Horse Tavern and Hotel Restaurant, it was good quality and there was a fair amount of choice on each menu. The Spa, although small offered a good quality service and provided very friendly, efficient staff. In fact the staff throughout the Resort were friendly and went out of there way to provide assistance. All in all a great way to end a hectic, holiday!",4,positive

Room was clean and comfortable; staff was very friendly, and we did enjoy our few days away. A few things that I question; 1.) both pools were very cold making it difficult to enjoy, 2.) although the food was great, there is no where to go for a light breakfast or lunch (only option for breakfast is buffet at $14.00 each), two options for places to eat are dining room or pub which makes it pricey. 3.) very quiet with little to do after dinner (park closes at 6:00, no entertainment or games area) and nothing close by if you leave the resort. Would be nice if they had some activities in the evening! We enjoyed our stay and enjoyed the zipline but not much else to do unless you are there with children and then it can get pricey with activities during the day.

Our family enjoyed the scenery, the clean modern rooms and our kids enjoyed the zip line and OGO. We had a great view on the third floor of the Inn, looking at a golf green from our sunken living room in a loft suite. The only negative and it is a big one is there is no bathroom door in the second floor bathroom. Sorry, I may be cool but I'm not that cool! Besides that everything was very nice. Also would have been nice to have thinner, softer pillows.

We didn't have time to go Niagara way, so I looked north, and east. Horseshoe Resort offered ""free golf with room"" and it was by far the best price. I had been reading the reviews here and was hesitant as the reviews were either wonderful, or horrible. I booked online, and hadn't been able to get a response re how to book our tee time (booking online required payment and our golf was to be free) but I popped a note here on Tripadvisor and immediately got a response from Lisa, who took care of everything - Lisa even called when we were at the resort. We played golf all day! The room was in great shape - clean, newly renovated. The staff was very friendly and the weather was the best all summer. We did a quick walkabout, but we went to play golf, and we did. We ate our meals at the Crazy Horse and all was tasty (little expensive) ......only thing I would do differently next time would be to bring more food, as there is a beer fridge in the room.

Pool: The small pool is nice at the inn. We were a bit disappointed in the big pool because while relaxing on Monday a children day camp came in and were splashing and running around. The counsellors were laying on loungers - not paying much attention to kids.   Dining: crazy horse has good food- basic bar foods! Service was good. Silks was not worth the prices of most dishes. We found it a bit pricey for our meals and the servers were not attentive - my husband was not impressed with his meal (duck) his rice was not cooked. We had 3 different people bringing us food and drinks and waiting 25 mins for our bill to be brought to us. We were disappointed   The layout of horseshoe is great!

221382663,barrie/ca/154980/185603/221382663.html,Horseshoe Resort,"My family of five including two children (9 and 12) and grandma stayed last week in a fifth floor, fully renovated condo. The condo had two bedrooms, the master with its own bathroom and king bed, a second bedroom with a queen bed, and it also had a new pull out sofa bed in the living room. There is a second bathroom across the hall from the back bedroom. The back bedroom is off the condo entrance and access balcony walk and comes with room darkening plantation shutters. FYI there is another empty small room with a window as you come into the condo which is carpeted and can be used to store empty suitcases, any equipment for hiking, etc. or could even be used for another bedroom in a pinch. The condo has a full kitchen with mostly everything you would need to prepare meals. It is one of the better ones I have used while on a holiday and has a stove, oven, microwave, full sized fridge, dishwasher, big sink, toaster....dishes, pots and pans, coffee mugs, glasses of all description, cutlery, and dish soap all provided. Bring your own paper towels/napkins though. The bathrooms had a small quantity of shampoo and conditioner and two full towels in each bathroom so you may want to bring a few of your own or ask for more as there is no maid service provided during your stay in the condos. A hairdryer was provided as well. There is a washer and dryer in the condo and after requesting laundry soap, we were able to take care of keeping our towels fresh and wash some of our clothes and swim suits. The condo is spacious and we didn't hear any noise during out stay, the beds were new and comfortable, and the televisions were new as well. One is in the master bedroom and one is just behind it in the living room. Our condo had a fireplace which we didn't use so I won't comment on and beyond a sliding door was a glassed in, mosquito netted balcony room equipped with chaise loungers and overlooking the pool and ski hills. These condos look to have been finished quite quickly in time for the season so a few small details have been missed like a vacuum cleaner or broom for clean-ups would be nice (a broom was provided upon request), extra dish clothes and towels, some windex for cleaning up the bathroom mirrors. We stayed for five days so without such cleaning items keeping the condo clean was a bit of a challenge. There needs to be a toilet roll holder put up in the master bathroom as well, the hairdryer needs to be affixed to the wall as well, and a doorstop would be great in the front door of the condo. When we arrived we weren't able to access the internet in 506 but they fixed the problem the next day. The condo was well situated and very comfortable for my family of five.   While at the resort, we went to the Adventure Park and both my girls had a good time. We all had a zip line ride but didn't make it to the OGO balls unfortunately as we ran out of time. On another day, we all went tree top trekking although we broke into two separate groups as my youngest wasn't tall enough to do the ""adult"" course and my mom wouldn't have been able to do it either so we climbed the ""child"" course and it was challenging enough for us. My husband and eldest daughter thoroughly enjoyed their adventure on the bigger course. On another day, we learned how to ride dirt bikes at Yamaha Adventures and while it is a bit more of a hit on the pocket book, we had a brilliant time learning that skill. We were fully covered in protective gear and all the instructors were professional and patient. The Segways were also pretty cool according to my husband and eldest daughter who spent a half day learning how to navigate the trails around Horseshoe. My girls both went swimming in the condo pool and had a great time and neither mentioned it being cold.   Barrie is about a twenty minute drive away if you want to pop out for a movie or shop, and there is a grocery store five minutes down the road as well. A few other restaurant options are also about five minutes by car from the resort. We had a fabulous time and will return another time.

221437845,barrie/ca/154980/185603/221437845.html,Horseshoe Resort,"We've just returned from 3 days and 2 nights at Horseshoe Resort. I was lucky enough to find a Wagjag offer that allowed us to experience Horseshoe while staying within this years vacation budget. Our package included passes to the Adventure Park, which the kids (and I) loved! The zipline and OGO balls were must-do's for us and were very much enjoyed. My only 'complaint' would be the hours of the Adventure Park (11-6 during the week).....the kids wanted to go back after dinner for more 'adventure', but it was too late at that point.   We stayed in a 2 bedroom Slopeside Condo, and were satisfied with our accomodations. Yes, there are improvements that could be made to make them more modern, and I'm sure will be made in time, but there was nothing that hindered our stay at all. Our condo had a screened in balcony (loved it in the evening when we were relaxing!) Having access to a kitchenette to make dinners was definitely a plus. Another perk was having 2 bathrooms....and a washer/dryer available in our condo if needed.  All staff that I dealt with (over the phone when making the reservation & inquiring about switching dates, to check in, at the Adventure Park, etc.) were more than friendly and accommodating.   We did enjoy lunch at the Crazy Horse Resturant, and were happy with the options available. The service was good and the food came quickly so we could go back to the park :)  We are definitely hoping to return to Horseshoe in the future to enjoy some of the other activities that are available.",5,positive

222520345,barrie/ca/154980/185603/222520345.html,Horseshoe Resort,"Even the rainy first day was enjoyable and peaceful. Food and beverage was good and accommodation was slope side renovated condo - highly recommend. It was clear work was being done to upgrade the facility so we would be excited to see it again this time next year.   Accommodation: Very quiet and restful at night although the hotel was clearly busy. Hotel is well suited to pets and prepared for pets.  Service: Overall each encounter was positive- employees were engaged and informed.  Hotel lobby and main dining area: Dinner in main dining area in hotel and the service were excellent. Lobby fireplace used on the cold day and/or bar service in the lobby-fireplace area are a must when weather is bad; atmosphere opportunity here.   Adventure Park: The most relaxing part for us was that we could park the car and not look at it again until we left two nights later. We were able to walk to the adventure park and even see it from the fifth floor walkway. The kids played in the maze like they were in a survivor episode and played basketball and mini-putt as the rain was coming to an end. The second day was sunshine and warm and we entered the adventure park again to zip-line and use the OGO ball park which were reopened in the good weather. The gold mining sounded a bit odd but the outcome was a lovely bag of little gems to take home as a keepsake for the younger child who did not weigh enough to zip-line. This zip-line is an excellent one for the beginner or risk adverse adventurer. No big crowds, just busy enough. Some work could be done to improve tuck shop arrival/ticket experience as 20 minutes in line for tickets with only one person working seems avoidable.Perhaps allow hotel concierge to distribute tickets or have separate line for hotel guests ticket purchase.   SPA We did not have time to use the service but did visit the spa and chat with the informed man at the desk. I would book a service next time.

Unfortunately it meant we couldn't enjoy all that Horseshoe had to offer. I was pleased to notice how friendly and helpful all the staff were. Every time I encountered staff of any function, I was directly engaged in a friendly and professional manner even if it was only passing in hallway.  Adventure Park was great and we were able to enjoy some of it but our stay would have been a bit more enjoyable if there was more to do in the bad weather. Perhaps a ""sit-in-movie"" in one of the conference rooms in the basement? Something to get you out of the room.  Had a great time Tree Top Trekking and Dirt-bike riding with SMART.   I am a SkyLife Rewards member and was disappointed to learn the booking was not made correctly to get the most benefit from that. I realize that is not Horseshoe's issue but I would offer that it was not evident in the booking process between the two that something was missed.

I can't say enough about the staff...extremely friendly and professional. The hotel and grounds were clean and it is a gorgeous property, but the website is very misleading. I was under the impression that all the things on your Adventure Park video were included, but very sadly, found that very little was in fact included. My older kids were too big for the Euro-Bungee and only one zip-line ticket was included. Even if we wanted to spend the extra money for zip-lining, tree trekking, segways, bikes and buggies, we couldn't because everything was fully booked. :( If I had been told by the person on the phone to book ahead, the experience would have been so much better. What could have been a wonderful, exciting weekend ended up being boring. Very sad. We spent a heck of a lot of money to pretty much sit around the hotel lobby all weekend.  The weather was awful on Saturday (no fault of Horseshoe obviously) and everything at the Adventure Park was closed. I wish there were some indoor activities for my little guy. Maybe a movie day in one of the conference rooms would have been a nice idea for rain days. There is only so much swimming a kid can do and that's the only option he had on Saturday.

We had a condo for 2 nights which was in MAJOR MAJOR need of repair and renovation. It included everything we needed, full kitchen, dishwasher, laundry but I couldn't get passed the feeling that everything FELT dirty. Having the screened it balcony was great though the carpet was torn to shreds & the chairs are cheap & uncomfortable. The beds were comfy. Pool loungers were amazing and our view overlooking the hill was great. The pool by the condos needs a major overhaul though it has a nice new deck. The adventure park was good, we got a day pass for the kids which we thought was priced right and the zip lining is worth the price of admission. My husband golfed & found a great price on golfnow.com but said it's pretty basic & wouldn't pay for a regular green fee. They've obviously put the money into the adventure park & not accommodations. None of us appreciated being awoken to horrible music blaring through the tree speakers at 9am one morning and the next the sound of construction while a backhoe and trucks did whatever they were doing outside our window (and our view).

The carpet was covered in stains and no one in my family would even walk on the floor without slippers. The bath rooms were also very dated and tired looking but more importantly, both bathrooms looked “unclean”. When my 13 year old son tells me “it’s not too clean here dad” believe me, his standard is not set too high.  When I mentioned my concerns at check out, they instantly told me they would take 25% off the room rate of about $300 which was appreciated however when checking my bill in the car, they had ADDED $50.00 so I had to go back to the front desk to get it corrected.

We weren't expecting much as it was still a bit early in the season and a last minute booking. Many activities were also not available for this reason.  SERVICE The staff was extremely friendly, and helpful upon arrival, and throughout our stay. The concierge gave us a free voucher for mini-putt, and was always there when we had questions or advice on activities.  ROOM We stayed in a Deluxe Room with 2 queen beds (as the single Kings were taken). The room was quite large and recently renovated with modern furniture and finishes. It featured ample room around the beds, and had a spacious lounge area with 2 chairs and an electric fireplace. It was great to also have a nice large TV, a fridge, and FREE WIFI.  BATHROOM This is where the recent renovations really shined. The bathroom was very contemporary with sleek lines, large glass shower, and 2-person bathtub (unfortunately not jetted). It was spacious and very clean.  RESORT Overall, we had a great time at the resort even though we only participated in a few activities. The mini-putt is fun and escalates up the side of a hill. We also rented cross-country bikes and took to one of the moderate trails nearby. The ride was beautiful, but be sure to carry insect repellant as they can be relentless!  FOOD There aren't many options for dining on site, however being just 15 minutes from Barrie, it's not much of an issue. We did try the Crazy Horse restaurant for lunch and it was reasonable. My fish and chips could have been better, however my wife's salad was very delicious.  There is also wonderful gourmet pizza place just off Pentanguishene Rd. 2 minutes from the resort. It is a part of a golf resort but open to the public. A must try!  OVERALL We had nice relaxing time at Horseshoe Resort. The fact that it was just off-season and quiet surely worked well in our favour. The resort isn't overly expensive, and with all the other activities they have to offer, this is a great place for either a quick couple getaway, or a lot of fun for the family.",4,positive

The zip line was fun, shorter than we expected and it was out first time. The rock climbing was good. We tried to use the bogo (going down hill in a big water ball) and was told we had to pay extra; weren't told from before. So yeah that basically ALL the activities.Not sure why it was called access pass with not much to do. So happy we didn't stay overnight.",4,positive

Unfortunately the adventure park was closed however a very nice employee offered to walk a distance just to grab us some clubs and balls to play a round of mini golf. What a nice gesture!!!! Almost everything was closed on the adventure park on the Friday as it is off season, so this was much appreciated especially since there wasn't much to do. We also got to enjoy a car show on the property which was fun also !!   The room was huge, immaculately cleaned, a Kurig coffee maker, fridge, hair dryer and lovely shower!

229980871,barrie/ca/154980/185603/229980871.html,Horseshoe Resort,"Really not what I expected. The lobby is dimly lit with the front desk tucked in to an even darker corner. The front desk clerk was not in the greatest of moods. When I asked if there were any upgrades available she responded no, we are full up. She also went on to mention that they had two weddings at the resort and if noise was an issue later, all we had to do was call the front desk and they would send security. Grrrreat!!!!  The resort is in some real need of renovation and repair and just overall better decorating. It's so drabby and old looking. The hallways are dimly lit and the carpet looks awful. The design looks like it's wet all down one side. The walk from the elevator takes forever and there is one really weird mirror that makes you look all distorted. Very bizarre.  The room was quite sparse. Hardly any pictures on the wall. Actually all but one is bare. There is only one chair in the room. I would have expected two chairs and maybe a table. A little ridiculous. The beds have linens that could probably stand up on their own. They are so bleached and tough feeling. Not to mention I requested a King bed as we are celebrating our 25th wedding anniversary and they gave us 2 queens.   The bathroom was clean but disorganized. There are no towel racks. You have to bend down under the sink to get them. Not good for people with bad backs. I thought towel racks were pretty standard. And first time my shower is just that. Just a shower stall which is nice. Clean but like I said disorganized.  The TV in the room is way too small for the size of the room. And it doesn't really matter because the reception is all fuzzy making it difficult to watch. Just add it to the growing list.   And just now, our furnace came on. It was so loud. We actually opened the door and looked out the window thinking a truck was driving by shaking the room. I poked my head out in the hallway and a room clerk happened to pass by and I asked her what the loud noise was. She told me each room has it's own furnace to control temperature. OMG it was loud. If that comes on at night I would have been scared out of bed.   I really wish I had been told all of this before booking so that I could have chosen another date. Possibly during the week.   As I sit here looking at the dreary, rainy afternoon from the bed because there is only 1 chair, I wonder what the resort has to offer when it's raining. Not much. We have to cancel our Segway Adventure which would have been nice.   Overall, from what we have experienced, Ontario does not have much to offer in great resorts. This one would be nice if you bulldozed it and started from scratch.  Might come to spend the day at the Adventure Park but will never stay the night again. Thank goodness we got this night at a silent auction for lower than actual price. Might not even stay through the night depending on noisy wedding guests.   Ontario needs to step it up if we want tourists to return. Thank goodness we live 1/2 hour away.

Wow! Lovely large room. Comfy king size bed, sunken sitting area with loveseat, sitting chair and footstool, fireplace and a wall of windows to look out at the start of the fall colours. The bathroom was spacious. Big tub, and separate shower. Generous counter space. A mini fridge and Keurig coffee maker were a nice touch. Everything was clean and comfy. Enjoyed both outdoor heated pools, and the indoor pool and hot tubs. Was not too busy, so often had them to ourselves. Had the Thursday night dinner for two special at the Crazy Horse restaurant. The food and drinks were very good, and close by. Sat comfortably by the cozy lobby fireplace while my husband enjoyed golfing and checked my emails, etc. Good internet.

I was given a map of the hiking trails by the resort however they did not properly reflect the trails, and the trails were not marked. The Spa entrance is very dated and completely without the spa ambiance of others that I have visited. The spa treatment I booked was for 75 minutes and from the time I was introduced to the attendant to the time I was back in the waiting room was more like 65 minutes. The treatment started with a salt scrub and was wiped off with a warm towel, I asked about a shower and was told ""we don't do that here"". I have had many of these treatments at other resorts and have NEVER not had a shower before proceeding with the treatment. Some of the scrub was indeed wiped off but much of it was either left on my body or on the sheet, with the addition of oil this simply left me running to the shower in my room when the treatment was over. Further, the treatment room I was in did not have a face cradle and this discomfort has since prompted me to make an appointment with my massage therapist due to a stiff neck. The resort lobby is in dire need of a face lift, wood and paint is chipped or worn off in many places, it is dark and unwelcoming. The food was quite good, however a large noisy group made dinner an unpleasant experience. The room was clean and the bed comfortable.",2,negative
235525971,barrie/ca/154980/185603/235525971.html,Horseshoe Resort,"We stayed for 2 nights in October 2014, and found this to be a very odd hotel. The whole place felt like a Holiday Inn Express run by amateurs. A few examples:  Our room appeared to have been recently painted, but we felt like they had forgotten a few things, or hadn't quite finished the job. Dominating the room was a big, blank wall with a bunch of outlets in it - did they forget to add a wardrobe or some artwork??   In the sitting area, there was a shabby sofa, a mismatched chair & tiny wibbly-wobbly side table - I think they forgot to add a coffee table or an armchair! The window in the sitting area was very drafty, so we tried to figure out how to operate the gas fireplace (no remote, no switch, no instructions). We called reception who gave us some unintelligble instructions on how to flip this, twist that, and push the other - we asked if someone could come down and show us, and two days later, we were still waiting. We never did enjoy the fire.   There was no room service menu in the room, so we called down to reception again, and were given a photocopied piece of paper with the restaurant menu on it - very Mickey Mouse!   The lighting in the room was terrible. The bedside lamps were so dim, it was impossible to read - there was only one other table lamp in the room and no overhead lights. I had to read using the flashlight app on my cell phone.   I was very surprised to see more than one guest with a dog on a leash walking down the hall (these were not service animals!) and even more suprised when I was awoken by a barking dog outside our door on Sunday morning. I have travelled a lot, and stayed in many different types of hotels, and that is definitely a first!   I went for a spa treatment one afternoon, and was puzzled by the fact that there is no signage to tell you that the spa is on the second floor. I wandered around the lobby and the health club for a few minutes trying to follow the arrows to the spa, and finally asked the girl at reception who explained that I needed to take the elevator up one floor - this was NOT obvious and should be signed much better in the lobby, by the elevator, and in the elevator.   All of the foregoing seem like they would be easy fixes, but my guess is that they have enough ski traffic in the winter from people who spend very little time in their rooms that they don't have to worry about minor inconveniences for their guests in the off-season.   On a brighter note, the food from the restaurant was delicious, and I thoroughly enjoyed my spa treatments.  Overall, we were disappointed and will not be returning.",2,negative
235943157,barrie/ca/154980/185603/235943157.html,Horseshoe Resort,"We held our wedding at Horseshoe Resort and were very disappointed. The staff demonstrated extremely poor organization and embarrassing customer service. After our initial wedding coordinator quit Horseshoe, we ran into problem after problem and planning our wedding was a nightmare. The events manager scheduled and missed two meetings on two separate occasions (wasting my time as it was a 6-hour round trip for me to get to Horseshoe from the Niagara region). We were told that basically everything in our original contract and our preferred ceremony locations were not possible with the new wedding coordinator. The hairstylists at the spa had quit and there was no one available to do our hair and makeup on site. When our troubles were brought up to the director of sales, Murray Lathem, he told us ""If Horseshoe is not right for you and you’d like to leave, then you should. If you’d like to continue with your wedding at Horseshoe, you’ll have to sweep everything under the rug”. Following this, our new coordinator was flakey. In one voicemail, she called my husband by the wrong name. She was unorganized and unprofessional. My guests had problems booking their hotel rooms and were also charged additional fees. The tables were not set as we had discussed and the mother of the groom was devastated to find that her table was set at the back of the room. The wedding coordinator was in all the photos of my father walking me down the aisle - she thought it was necessary to follow me to adjust my dress (something we never discussed prior). We are appalled that our guests had poor experiences dealing with the hotel reservation staff as several had trouble booking rooms or were charged the wrong price. One of our guests was charged for ""ordering music"" on his television which was a mistake (he is over 60 years old) but the hotel refused to take off the charge. Another guest was told he never paid the deposit and had to pay it again before he could get into his room. Overall, we were extraordinarily disappointed with the poor customer service, the extreme disorganization demonstrated by the management staff, and the fact that we felt that we were not valued customers; especially after all of the money we had put into hosting our event at Horseshoe Resort.",1,negative

We first became familiar with it 10 years ago during family snowboarding trips. We enjoyed sitting in the lounge by the fire then...and again enjoyed it on our recent weekend. Every staff person we met was helpful and professional and couldn't have been nicer. Our room was very clean and comfortable with updated decor and a couple of comfy chairs by a large window fitted with plantation shutters overlooking a treed hill - very pretty in fall. We would suggest that towel bars be installed in the bathroom in addition to hooks, and that a brighter lamp or two be added to each room for those of us who love to read. The Sunday brunch was amazing - delicious variety including awesome home-made breads. We had heard from others that the walking trails are not well-marked, but these are not actually part of the resort property. We got lots of exercise without leaving the resort grounds by swimming in the sunny indoor pool and hot tub, and exploring the 9-hole golf course set amidst beautiful hills and trees.

My spouse and I were impressed from the minute we entered the lobby of this hotel. There is something so comforting about the smell of the wood-burning fireplace when you step inside. We had an efficient check-in and were let in to our room over an hour early, which we truly appreciated.   The package we booked included sparkling wine and chocolates, both of which were waiting for us when we arrived to our suite. The suite was newly renovated, with a spacious bathroom, sleeping area and sitting area. The bed was fairly comfortable and the furniture accents were all appropriate for the space.   We indulged in the hot tub and sauna, both located in their fitness center. I was surprised to see their fitness center included a small, but well-equipped fitness room, as well as a squash court.  The spa is quaint, yet provides the customer services of a large-scale operation. We had a great couples massage and felt that the RMTs really cared about our problem areas. They did not just settle with giving us a run-of-the-mill relaxation massage, but took into account our needs. This is not always the case when receiving spa treatment in a hotel package and we truly appreciated it.   Our dinner at Silks was exquisite. We ordered off of their Autumn Equinox menu and enjoyed every single bite. In addition, the hot breakfast served the next morning was above average and supremely delicious. Hats off to the chef and his/her team!  I am so glad that we took a chance on Horseshoe Resort.

Newly renovated room, very large and comfortable. Bathroom was a good size and very modern, bed was exceptionally comfortable. Much of the hotel appears to have been renovated and looks great.   Staff were very friendly, great check-in experience. Free wifi was a nice touch. Breakfasts were generously sized and tasty. Spa staff were wonderful.  Our only complaint was that our stay happened during the 'twilight zone' time between the summer activities ending and the winter activities not yet gearing up. Aside from the spa and the pool/sauna, there was virtually nothing available to do at the resort. All the activities - horseback riding, zip lining, etc. - were deserted and unstaffed. Lots of construction happening on the property with new condos going up, but that did not intrude on our stay. The on-site casual restaurant was closed for renovations, so we had to drive 20 minutes into Barrie to eat unless we wanted to use the high-end restaurant - which was probably very nice, but we wanted something different. This is probably why the Wagjag deal was so good, but no fault of the resort. We would stay here again, but likely in the summer or winter rather than the late fall.

240829785,barrie/ca/154980/185603/240829785.html,Horseshoe Resort,"I had the unfortunate luck of booking the Fall Couple's Retreat package at Horseshoe Resort in Barrie for my boyfriend's birthday. The package included a couple's massage, a bottle of wine, truffles, and a three course dinner. When I first called to book this package (a month in advance), I was told that the usual rooms provided for this package were fully booked. Due to this, I was given no choice but to add $125 dollars to upgrade the room.   Upon arrival, we were informed that there were 250+ kids and teenagers staying at the hotel for a variety of reasons (leadership retreat, hockey tournament, etc.) Would this not be the kind of information to disclose during the time of booking? This is especially relevant because I was weighing my options between Horseshoe Resort and the Skandinave Spa in Collingwood. Safe to say, I made a horrible choice by going with Horseshoe. There were teenagers banging on our door all night. We had to call down to the front desk three times, and my boyfriend physically went down there once. At one point, we went and sat in the car for a moment of peace. At 7:00am, we were woken up to screams, and a note from the teenagers under our door asking us for drugs (?????).  Now, for the spa. This was by far the most awkward spa my boyfriend and I have ever experienced. We were put in the couple's massage room and told to undress. However, there were no robes, no where to put our clothing. I don't know about you, but I have never been to a spa where I had to put my clothes in a pile on the floor... just completely unacceptable. I booked two RMTs, but upon arrival, only one of the masseuses was a RMT. In addition, my masseuse was seemingly being trained by my boyfriend's masseuse; always looking over to see what the other was doing and repeating the same actions and phrases. It was very hard to relax.   On to the dinner. While our server was very sweet, the food was lacklustre. Completely not up to the calibre of the ""fine dining three course meal"" we were promised. The cherry on top of this ""fine dining"" experience was a little girl running around in her bathing suit. Have you ever been to a 'fine dining' restaurant that allowed half dressed children inside? Me neither.   The staffed SEEMED to be very understanding about this. Erin, the supervisor, informed me that the room upgrade fee would be returned to me, and that the resort manager, as well as the spa manager, would be contacting me the next day to discuss further remedy for the horrible stay we had.   However, after a week, the $125.00 room upgrade fee return has yet to make its way to my credit card, and a completely random 99.00 fee was charged to me by Horseshoe. I have also yet to hear from either the manager (Ivan) or the spa manager. When my boyfriend called to inquiry about this, the front desk informed him that while the $99.00 charge was in fact there, there was no given reason for this charge. Nice, Horseshoe. Offer a refund only to take it back.   I am completely appalled by the service at Horseshoe Resort Barrie. My friends and family have heard about the horrible experience we had, and I thought it was only fair that anyone else contemplating booking here should be aware of this too. I used to frequent Horseshoe Resort years ago, and this is NOT the same calibre of service I had become accustomed to.   If you are looking for chain hotel, nothing special about it, kid friendly experience... book at Horseshoe. However, this hotel should not offer couple's retreat packages, or even attempt to book to anyone without children.

The beds & sheets -good, pillows were hard, the towels old and thread bare. the shower glass - modern, but they cheaped out on the faucets and cleaning. This could be a great property but it needs some fine tuning on finishings.. Continuity is what people remember and clean bathrooms are an absolute must.

244404382,barrie/ca/154980/185603/244404382.html,Horseshoe Resort,"Just stayed last week at Horseshoe Resort. It was a girls get together overnight thru Wagjag. We stayed a Thursday night as the voucher was only good Sunday thru Thursday. I never get to see my BFF as she lives a fair distance away and has there kids and we have a hard time getting together, so nothing could have spoiled our getaway. First off it was dead quiet as there seemed to be no one staying that night, Normally I like going off times but this left the place with a bit of a ""The Shining"" feel to the resort. Everything closed at 10 PM, including the dining room, which would have been nice to know upon check in as we checked in after 9PM and no one at the front desk thought to warn us if we wanted a snack or coffee and dessert that we had less than an hour. We came down about 9:50 looking for a drink and we were told sorry the restaurant was closed at 10:00 PM. The staff were a bit unfriendly about it actually, like we were bothering them while they were cleaning up. The said that there was a place called Crazy Horse across the way. But we didn't want to go out again as it was winter, cold, and we had just driven a couple of hours to get there. We were too tired. All we wanted was a hot chocolate. We asked at the front desk if we could get one somewhere and someone from the kitchen overheard and said if all we wanted was a hot chocolate she could get that for us. That was nice of her. The first couple of restaurant staff couldn't get rid of us quick enough. So we went up to the room and had a tub each. The room was very nice, spacious with a gas fireplace. We realized it was pretty cold in the room so we put the fire on and it did not throw much heat, I guess it is more for ambiance...we talked to the front desk and they said that the maintenance person had gone home at 10 as well and the only option was moving us to another room. We had already unpacked and had jammies on so we said not to worry about it. We tried to book a spa treatment online from our room but were unable. Again called the front desk to inquire and were told their site was not working and they could not book anything in the spa until morning. So we waited till the AM to speak to the spa people. Luckily they were able to fit us in. We had a pre-booked massage and then had added a pedicure afterwards. The massage was ok, not bad but not great. The pedicure was the worst we've ever had. At $60 it should have been stellar! Overall, we had a comfortable stay but the little things like good service and heat stick with you. Unfortunately a number of those things were lacking on this stay.",3,negative

We checked into our room about 8:45pm Friday night, walked into our room it was VERY cold we thought the heat had just been turned on and we would wait for it to warm up. We finally fell asleep freezing hoping it would warm up soon. I woke up throughout the night cold but was to tired to deal with front desk at this point. When we woke in morning our room was so cold we couldn’t even get out of our bed without freezing. The hall ways were warmer than our room. I finally complained at front desk and I had to remind them three times about our heat issue before we got a new room.    Also our room was very empty when we walked in, it was missing the double pull out couch down in the so called living room. I asked the front desk about it missing a couch they asked how many people in our room and I said two so they acted as if the couch wasn’t important. But we booked this room to have a living room with a couch to be able to sit at by the fireplace. The first room we stayed in was just in horrible condition, missing furniture and not very clean at all. Not what I expected.Needless to say it was not a very good first impression for us.",2,negative

The weather was perfect not to cold and enough chair lifts and runs open for a great day. The room was ready when we checked in early and the service was fantastic. Everyone was friendly and helpful. Ivan the spaniard is the best. He works hard to please the guests and is very cheerful. There was only one minor surprise when one of the girls assigned another guest our room number by accident. But they apologized serval times to me and my husband. It is very busy with the holiday season but the resort handled everything so well. We never had to wait for resturant service and the food was great. My boys loved the burgers at the crazy horse restaurant and I enjoyed the specially coffee at the shoe brew cafe. We will definitely be back again with the family and look forward to seeing Ivan the spaniard.,4,positive

Like it was my problem. Stayed in the main lodge where rooms were updated but overall resort was dirty. The hallways remained unvaccumed for the 3 days we were there with dirt from outside traipse in. And rooms were not cleaned well either.The highlight was the great outdoor activities, amazing tubing hill and great helpful staff there that make it super fun.

Then, we received a decent customer service from Ivan (Front desk manager). Ivan was very understanding and courteous and he handled the situation smoothly and professionally for us.

247275795,barrie/ca/154980/185603/247275795.html,Horseshoe Resort,"We have been coming to this ski resort for over 20 years, and staying at the Inn every Friday night for at least the last 5 years. I would like to put some of the negative comments into perspective! Yes, the rooms are as expensive as some in Lake Louise, but we are not in Lake Louise, we are in Ontario, and Horseshoe is the best ski resort we have, in my humble opinion, and rooms are limited, so the rates will not be bargain basement! From my experience, rooms at Blue Mountain are even more expensive, and the snow not nearly as good, and the crowds ridiculous. The season passes are also not much less than out West, but we are not out West, so it is what it is. We love Horseshoe, and the Inn. We, too, have had some service bumps over the years, but by and large, this property continues to improve. This season we noticed new carpeting and other changes in the main lodge and restaurants, and more updates to the Inn. There really is nothing like this resort so close to Toronto, and it makes a SUPER getaway for families, or couples. It is also THE best place to enroll your kids in ski lessons and racing programs. No, it is not ""slick"", but I don't think it is supposed to be. So if you arrive with a desire to have a great, fun weekend, and are patient with any little waits, because sometimes it is busy around check-in time, then you will enjoy a relaxing getaway unparalleled anywhere else so close to home!

No complimentary water or beverages. The restaurants closed by 11pm and the overpriced vending machine ran out of water as well. When we approached the front desk on this issue we were told to just drink the tap water (which had a funny taste).  Conclusion: For the cost and service, it was not worth the stay.

Also we needed an extra bed which they informed us would cost extra each night, but they didn't add it to our bill which I really appreciated.

We had a great stay. The only thing that was wrong was our bed- the mattress sunk in a little in the middle (I am a super small person so I knew the mattress needed to be changed or flipped). Other than that the room was roomy and comfortable. Great hotel amenities, especially receiving free lift tickets along with the purchase of a one night stay at the hotel so it is worth it if you plan to ski. We asked the service desk about the shops nearby and she suggested we go to a family owned restaurant only 5 minutes away. We went to the local dinner place down the street called Abott's (I believe) I strongly suggest going there for dinner, amazing food!!!

The resort blasts very loud music on the slopes from all the lifts from 8 am to 9 pm. All slope side rooms will be noisy during these times and skiing is annoying unless you like their terrible taste in loud music.  The heating system in our room is louder than a 747 jet engine. Many guests complained about thier old loud heating system, and it certainly kept us and our kids up at night, and would wake us up again each time it turned on, a sound very similar to a jet taking off.  At 7am the grooming machines start up including the annoying reverse beeping signals that will start your day.  There are groups of teenagers wondering the halls until midnight, their conversations screams and laughs come right in the room through the half inch gap under the door.

We arrived a couple of hours early and Ivan at Reception was so warm and welcoming. Ivan confirmed our room was ready and let us check in. He asked how many keys were required and provided a quick orientation to the property which was appreciated.  We headed over to The Lodges condominiums to unit 507 - top floor. It was beautiful and I highly recommend this tastefully appointed 2-bedroom, 2 bathroom premium unit with all the amenities. It is tastefully decorated with an urban chic decor. The beds were so comfortable as was the sofa bed. Our unit held 6 people very comfortably. The fireplace with a complimentary fire log added a beautiful ambience while watching the skiers shush down the slopes. The music from the ski hill was current and we rather enjoyed it.   We unpacked and headed to the tubing hill and shrieked and laughed for 2 hours. If you haven't tried it, you must. What fun you can have at the Adventure Park for $20. We were a bunch of 50-something women who made the attendants laugh with our giggles. We enjoyed a lovely hot chocolate and warm up around the fire before heading back to our room to make dinner in our beautiful kitchen.  The next day after going dogsledding using a 3rd party provider, we booked massages at Shizen Spa which were incredible! We would have loved a 90 minute Shizen treatment but were just as happy with a 60 minute deep tissue massage. Tim was my RMT and was extremely professional and amiable. I would ask for him by name next time. Reception at Shizen were warm and inviting and gave me a lemon water to drink while filling in the paperwork. There is always paperwork. Some of the ladies enjoyed the hot tub for a while also.  Saturday evening we checked out the Crazy Horse Saloon (next door) thinking there would be live music, and were disappointed there was not. We made the best of it though and headed back after a couple of drinks to enjoy our last evening in our unit.  Overall, our stay at Horseshoe Valley Resort was excellent. As a customer service expert, I was impressed with the speed our requests were handled. We asked for an extra fire log every day and they were very accommodating at no charge. Every service representative we met had a smile on their face and actually looked like they enjoyed their work. Even the attendant on the tubing hill standing outside in 20C weather. They all made the experience wonderful. Thank you all!  If I was going to make suggestions they would be:  1) Better quality wifi - it worked but was intermittent. 2) Provide additional garbage/recycling bags. 3) Ensure there are enough linens for the number of occupants so we don't have to call. 4) Phone lines were crackling. Not sure it was the system or phone itself in the unit.  We were there to relax so wifi was not all that important but if I was there for a longer stay, it would be extremely important to my experience.  Congratulations on the excellent customer service experience! I will return.

We had a deluxe room I believe...king bed with sunken living area with pullout couch. Our room was clean and spacious (we had a lot of gear).The only thing was the lighting in the bathroom...a bit too dim. The shower and bath were clean and big. It was a particularly busy weekend at the hotel with a hockey? tournament so there were a lot of people at the pool and hot tub area. It did need a little more attention as there were no towels left and a bit untidy in the change/shower room.

The carpets were stained and walls were cracked and it smelled very bad. Our first meal was in the Crazy Horse. We went there for dinner. The restaurant was busy but not full, it took a while to get a table and once we did it took a long time for our server to bring us our drinks. Once we ordered it was 45 minutes until we got our food and by that point it was cold. But it still tasted good.  We went skiing the next day the girls at guest services were really wonderful and efficient. The line was long but it moved really quickly. After getting our tickets we went out on the hill. The skiing was awesome. It had snowed the night before and there were a few runs that were still covered in snow so that was fun to ski on compared to the machine groomed hills.   The next day we went to the tubing hill. The staff were really fantastic! All of them were energetic and ensuring that all of the customers were happy. We enjoyed going to Ray’s line at the top of the hill he was really good with the kids and he was very energetic. When everyone rotated spots he got moved to the bottom and was still awesome with everyone there as well. But on our last run of the day as we were finishing up an older man walked up to Ray with a very upsetting attitude, he told Ray that he looks very unprofessional with his long hair and his beard. (we didn’t think he looked unprofessional in any way) And that he demanded that he fixed it! I was appalled by the way that this man was speaking to one of his staff members. Especially in front of all of the customers that were around. There could have been many ways to say that professionally and using a unpleasant, rude tone and in front of customers was not the right way to go about it . But the most appalling part of it was when I asked another staff member working who that man was they told me that his name is Kevin and he is the General Manager of the resort! I am shocked that the staff members were in such good spirits when upper management treats them that way.  Overall the trip wasn’t bad. Rooms could have been nicer, food could have been hot and upper management could take a class on leadership and how to politely speak to your employees. But the activities were fun.",3,negative

251255322,barrie/ca/154980/185603/251255322.html,Horseshoe Resort,Our family enjoyed a great weekend at Horseshoe this past weekend. (January 22-25th) The staff was friendly and allowed us to check-in early (12:00 instead of 4:00). Our room was adequate but I was disappointed with the washroom as the light was poor and the shower was leaking. The beds were very comfortable and each room was equipped with Keuring coffee maker. The front desk was very accommodating and gave additional K-cups throughout the weekend. I only wish that there were beside tables for all the beds. The ski lodge was efficient and very helpful. We had no problem renting our skis and purchasing our lift tickets. Our experience at other locations has been very long line-ups and few staff working. The hills were well-groomed and the staff was very friendly. The tubing was great and the again very friendly staff. The pool was clean but had too much chlorine so I would advise goggles. The Silk Restaurant was too fancy for our family weekend so we went to the Crazy Horse for dinner. I recommend the Firecracker burger if you have a big appetite but the meals were on the pricey side. The cafeteria is a good option for lunches. We bought a litre of soup to supplement the cheese and fruit platter we brought with us. It suited us just fine. We took advantage to the Skyline presentation for timeshares and earned $150 off our hotel stay. Our kids loved the weekend. Enjoyed the skiing and tubing and swimming. We planned to return again and maybe stay in the condos as they have much more room and allow for you to cook your own meals with an adequate kitchen. I also enjoyed a massage at the spa. They were very busy and didn't have enough rooms for all of the clients so there was a bit of a wait. My RMT was very chatty so that was a tad annoying. But the facilities were clean and again very friendly staff.,4,positive

The resort is a well-oiled machine with lots of outdoor things to do, from tubing, alpine and cross country skiing, skating to snow-mobiling. The restaurants and cafeteria on site are ok, the Crazy Horse restaurant service (or kitchen not sure where the blockage was) was on the slow side but the food was descent. Rent a condo so you can cook your own meals  We rented a 2 bedroom 2 bathroom condo which was in excellent condition and very clean, facing the slopes, great kitchen fully equipped, no dished for mama!!

Skyline is trying to get people to join their vacation club, which is fine and I know they have a job to do but they called me a few days before my trip to try and get me to sit in on their demo and get a free $100, I advised them I was not interested (the person couldn't believe it and tried the hard sell) but I advised I was going to board and I would like to be removed from the call list as well. We checked in everything was fine except room not ready until exactly 4pm but that's OK as was expecting that, got into the room and we had an empty Kleenex box and not coffee cups for the Kuerig so had to have some brought up. The next morning at 9am hotel phone rang and it was once again Skyline, this is totally unacceptable to me since I asked to be removed and for them to use the hotel to try and recruit people for the vacation club is not good in my book. I declined the gift they had at the front desk for me (again they cannot believe and try the hard sell) and I was upset now...we left to board around 1130am and returned at 5pm to find room was not touched another strike and when asked if we could get it cleaned that advised was too late now and house keeping was done for the day. This is too bad as we do a lot of these small trips through out the winter and now that skyline is trying to do hard sells on time share, I won't be returning here again.",1,negative

Shizen Spa treatments were first class, our dog was welcome, and the skating rink was a treat. Friendly, helpful staff overall. No experience with dining, as we opted to self-cater. We booked a slope side condo, which was advertised as having a 'fully equipped kitchen'. In our books, it was bare necessities, including a vintage dishwasher that was not fully functional and a stove with only two working elements and an oven door we had to arm-wrestle to open. Next time, we'll request a Premiere condo and hope for a happier experience - but the music from the slopes will still thunder on until ten at night.

It was fantastic to be able to bring our dog along, and he received a little welcome package - very nice touch. The condo was recently renovated, very clean and had everything we needed (full kitchen). There was even a small room at the door to accommodate all of our equipment. There was music on the slopes and tubing until 10 each evening. We could hear it from inside the condo, but it wasn't a problem. Staff at the tubing was so friendly and fun - and great with kids (big and small). We enjoyed the firepits, had good experiences at the Shizen spa, enjoyed snowshoeing (free as we were guests) and downhill skiing. Ski rental staff were very helpful. The indoor pool was also a big hit. The outdoor rink was closed while we were there, but there was so many other activities, we didn't miss it. The staff at the front desk was unfailingly chipper and genuine. We did not use the onsite dining. The hotel referred us to Yamaha Riding Adventures (there is a link to them from the hotel website), which was also AMAZING. Really enjoyed our stay, and will be back soon.

252072364,barrie/ca/154980/185603/252072364.html,Horseshoe Resort,"It became our family tradition to spent almost every Christmas at Horseshoe resort for the past 11 years. We even have been recognized by some of resort staff as a repeatable guests. We were not aware that the owners and the management of the hotel have been changed recently and the friendly staff we got used to is gone… This year we had our worst Christmas vacation ever.  We purchased the package of 2 night/3 days stay in the deluxe room including breakfast and skiing + $100 resort spending credit as a part of this package. The whole package was pretty expansive but I promised my kids to have family Christmas vacation at Horseshoe. Because of the weather we were able to ski only on our first day. Two other days the temperature was +7 C and rain. We have prepaid for unlimited skiing for two adults and two kids as part of the package deal. We came to the reception and explained the situation regarding the related to weather skiing unavailability and asked the reception manager to credit the money we have paid for skiing towards our next year Christmas vacation skiing or accommodation. The reception manager agreed with our arguments and gave us credit of $200.00 we paid for skiing in addition to the $100.00 we already had as a part of the package. But only on one condition- we have to spend it all during our current stay. She also advised us that we have to spend $300.00 out of our pocket first and upon our check out she will reimbursed $300.00 back to us. We agreed. We have decided to go to Crazy Horse restaurant for a dinner to spend some of our credit. For the dinner we have paid cash $125.00 in total including gratitude’s (the bill was $104 and change). We did not requested any change and the waitress did not gave us our receipt. Next morning I came to the same front deck lady to confirm that they keep on tracking the money we spending because their waitress fail to give us the receipt last night. She asked me not to worry and promised to get the copy of the receipt from the restaurant. I was shocked when she have got the copy of the receipt and the bill was altered with some phony 20% “ski” discount and it showed not $125.00 we paid but $80 something $ including tax with a change given back to us up to penny without any tip left on our side. I told her that the bill is counterfeited and asked her to bring down our last night waitress for conversation. She told me that our waitress is off today.  I demand to talk to the hotel manager. She told me that he will be on duty on the evening shift. When the same night I came to the reception in order to talk to hotel manager I have got another “surprise”. Without any concerns regarding restaurant altered bill the manager by the name Ivan told me that he is not aware and he is not honoring any $200.00 credit the reception manager gave me. I advised him to bring down reception manager for the conformation. He told me that tonight is her night of. I suggested that he can call her and confirm everything. He called her and first she told him that she do not know anything about our credit but when I asked to have conversation with her and he gave me the phone she confirmed the credit but she told me that she gave it by mistake!!! I told hotel manager that you cannot call the mistake when first you giving somebody credit and at the same time you encouraging the person to spend this credit during her time of stay because it is not transferable. Later when the money already spend( by that time we have already got second family dinner for $135.00 at the same restaurant) you simply saying that it was the mistake. This is not a mistake. It is a scam. The hotel manager told me that he cannot help me and he is not willing to discuss it any further. I request to talk to his superior. He promised to arrange it for next morning. Next morning we have to wait for over three hours for Mr. Kevin Toth who introduced himself as general manager. Later we figured out that in reality he is C.O.O. of Skyline Resorts Int., the company owner of the Horseshoe resort. We explained him our situation and suggested that we can proof our words if he can to bring down booth individuals involved. One from the restaurant another from the reception for the conformation. He refused saying that it is resort internal issue and he do not want us to get involved or be at any more inconvenience we already are. He also assured us that he is capable to conduct the investigation himself. He apologized and promised that he will personally sign and mail us the check for money the resort own us. Three days later instead of a check we received the email from Mr. Kevin Toth advising that his three days “investigation” is over. As a result no resort own us money but we have an outstanding balance of $50.00 which he is willing to credit for the three days of our family inconvenience… I am almost forgot about our Christmas dinner experience at the same Crazy Horse restaurant. Our Christmas dinner was a disaster!!!! For some reason the management of the resort decided that 3 waitresses would be enough for serving 250+ people on Christmas Night!!! The lack of waitress resulted in an hour and a half average meal waiting time if you lucky and you got served with what you ordered from the first try. In our case first waitress brought us something we did not order. Then we have to wait again but it was late and our kids got tired waiting for the food in packed noisy restaurant. They want to go to the hotel and wait for their food in the room. When we brought them their food to the room they have been already sleeping. My kids went to sleep hungry on the Christmas Eve!!! For the past three weeks I have been emailing to the C.E.O. of the Skyline Resorts Int. Mr. Sneyd and the Chairman Mr. Blutrich in order to bring their attention to booth incidents and do something in order it never happened again to somebody else. They booth refusing to accept any liability. For my three weeks of emailing I have got only one reply from them with the offer of some free lift tickets… I refused. P.S. Think twice if you planning to visit Horseshoe resort unless you want to be tricked, cheated and scammed every step of your way. The place is rotten and dishonesty is approved norm of conduct for the resort employees.",1,negative

We were pleasantly surprised at the friendliness of the staff, meticulously clean rooms, variety of activities to participate in and ease of use. This quiet, peaceful resort is family orientated and fun!  The only two issue we had were: 1) Lack of clearly labeled areas. This being my first experience on the property, I was driving about trying to locate our ""hotel"" entrance. I understand that some of the units are owned condo buildings and perhaps one would not want such areas ladened with signs but at least label the main hotel area so that one would easily find where to check in. 2) Lack of designated parking area for overnight guests. Once I left the 10minute check-in parking space, I could not find parking anywhere near the hotel area... I had to park at the opposite end of the property near the main road entrance (parking area for skiiers). This was quite a hike with our overnight & sports baggage! As with other reviews, we did have a phone call to our room from Skyline saying that they had a gift for us at the desk in the lobby. She was very polite and to the point. This call had to do with vacation club sales so we did not bother to investigate our ""free"" gift.  Attached is a photo of the skating rink; It would have been a better skating experience had the snow been cleared for skating but it just added to the experience! We were so impressed with this relaxing, family based & activity orientated resort that we will be returning; and this time with the whole family!! Thank you to staff/employees for a wonderful experience at Horseshoe Valley Resort!

The slopes are good, the personal are nice. I would stay again.  A couple of points, there is nothing open after 10 in the resort, no restaurants, bar or anything for that matter.

252475824,barrie/ca/154980/185603/252475824.html,Horseshoe Resort,"Stayed in their regular condos (not deluxe) since the bed configurations met our needs (Queen + 2 twins). Didn't see the upgraded condos (5th floor), but the one we stayed in was truly sad.  Still in the 70's... couch needed a blanket on it as it looked scary and had a permanent smell of fart.  ""Fully equipped"" kitchen wasn't even a quarter equipped. One bowl, a knife with which I had to chisel carrots, no frying pan (luckily got one when calling front desk) and a dishwasher so loud that it drowned out the TV in the other room.  Drop-ceiling lights in bathroom hanging precariously. Fan in bathroom sounding like a tractor, and the ceiling ""heater"" option smelled like it was about to burn the place down.  All furniture wobbly and loose.  Only saving grace was a comfortable bed with good linens and a nice view of the slopes from the balcony.  Pool and hot tub were nice, as was the squash court, but gym equipment in bad shape, no towels in the change room (had to get some from the gym) and not a very good system as muddy/sandy floor in change room that you have to walk on barefoot after your swim was gross.  Nice proximity to GTA, but wouldn't even consider a return until all condos are renovated. I would be embarrassed as Skyline Hotels and Resorts to sell these rooms.

252956172,barrie/ca/154980/185603/252956172.html,Horseshoe Resort,"I have been extremely impressed most of the elements of this resort. The key senior team members there have cooperated so well to enable me to achieve my objective, that is, enabling my two-year-old daughter to learn to ski.  When my daughter turned 2, and ahead of the winter season, I contacted the resort. Within a short space of time the Snow School Director and Sport Programs Manager, Brooke Lidstone contacted me to give me advice is to what they could be done to help my daughter learn. She was incredibly helpful. Together, we formulated a plan to enable my wife, daughter and mother-in-law to stay several nights a week at the hotel enabling my daughter to have a lesson in the morning, have a nap and then a lesson in the afternoon on Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays and, therefore, learn to ski very quickly. Brooke is in charge of a large number of ski instructors, I think it is the region of 80 and she picked an ideal instructor, for a girl of my daughter’s age, Patti, a mother of young children herself.  What particularly impressed me was the excellent coordination between Brooke and the Front Office Manager, Ivan Mansanet. Between the two of them, they arranged dates and times of both the lessons and the accommodation in a seamless manner. This one stop shop, was a very big plus for me, not having to worry about juggling two separate yet related bookings. The rate they provided me with, having regard to weekly stays, was very competitive. On the occasions that some variation had to be made to the tuition time, or day, the hotel reservation was amended accordingly, without any effort on my part.  On the day that we arrived, back in December, we had a personal welcome from Brooke, which I was most surprised about, to have the Director herself come. She stayed for the duration of the first lesson and then popped back in the afternoon. From time to time, over the last months, she has come to enquire how things are going and has regularly liaised with the instructor Patti.  We have been delighted with Patti. Our daughter has made very swift progress and loves being with her. She talks during the week about looking forward to having lessons with Patti.  Ivan, the Front Office Manager, exudes warmth. It is so apparent as you arrive, and throughout your stay. Obviously, he has a number of young girls working for him: some excellent and some do not always quite reach that mark.This is to be expected in any hotel. I see Ivan constantly encouraging, training and mentoring his team. What is particularly significant about him is that he has made an effort, from day one, to provide us with his contact details for use, if necessary. A very warm man, who has really made the stays particularly enjoyable.  Today, what prompted me to write was the amazing cooperation that I received from Ivan and his colleagues, in particular the Snow Patrol. I had to come to the resort to transport and urgent medicine to my daughter. The snow was so bad that the police blocked off the road to the resort. I managed to pull into another resort, make contact with Ivan and literally within 10 minutes, he had arranged for the Snow Patrol to come on snowmobiles, in dangerous weather and over difficult terrain to transport the item for my daughter. It was worthy of a movie script, having these two young men on their snowmobiles arrive so quickly, with the delight on their faces that they been able to help in this way.   The resort is characterized, I feel, by a genuinely friendly attitude on the part of the vast majority of the staff, from chambermaids to wait staff. It is a great place for children. I certainly will consider,when the snow was gone, taking my daughter back for summer pursuits there.  The actual hotel is clean and pleasant. It is obviously more ski lodge than grand hotel. There are good amenities such as swimming pool, spa and the like. So, indeed, quite a pleasant place to go, even if you are not skiing.   I have to be objective in this my review and say that although the management seem to have done extremely well in recruiting some very, very charming people for management and staff, they do have room for improvement in the food department. The main restaurant in the hotel, Silks, has very pleasant wait staff, and the quality of the food is reasonably good. The café, Crazy Horse, which is a few steps from the ski slopes, serves food which leaves a lot to be desired. This is disappointing, because, again, some pleasant wait staff there. With excellent standards that I referred to above, in regard to the front office, reservations and coordinating of ski instruction, it would be quite beneficial to the overall guest experience (and therefore goodwill factor) if standards on the food side could be improved.  Having regard to the whole experience, though, I would very much recommend this resort to TripAdvisor readers.",4,positive

253562432,barrie/ca/154980/185603/253562432.html,Horseshoe Resort,"My husband has always loved going to Horseshoe Resort. But, We were both very disappointed this time. The skiing was wonderful, but the staff couldn't seem to give us the adjoining rooms that we had booked. When they finally did, the door that opened between the rooms had a lot of dirt and grit on the floor and hadn't been cleaned for a long time. Also, the heating unit in our unit broke so that they had to put in a portable heater to keep us warm. We had a lovely room with a fireplace and sunken sitting area. I asked housekeeping to wipe down part of the wall that was very dirty and covered in a large, brown spill as young children would be touching it. I was told by staff not to let them sit on the carpet, but to put down a sheet first to protect the kids from the germs. Obviously, the carpet needed to be replaced. If that wasn't enough, after returning from skiing, our foyer was full of water on the floor that had leaked out of the ceiling..it flowed into the joining room where our adult children were staying. The staff tried to compensate us, but I don't think I'll ever go back there. The once, beautiful resort is getting old and the wear and tear from skiers is visible. Also, there were many, large dogs left in the rooms. I was told they were only on the second floor, but saw one in our third floor hallway. My daughter said she couldn't let the baby nap as there must have been a crying dog in the unit next to her that cried all day while the owners were out skiing.

I feel the need to write to a short note to let you know how much I enjoyed my day there .I am not an advanced skier, but have been skiing for about 8 years now. In the past I have mainly skied at Blue Mountain. I say in the past because I now have a new favourite hill – Horseshoe!. I love the variety of ski hills you have, all of them so much fun and each one different and Challenging in it’s own way. Not only are the hills enjoyable, your staff is awesome! Staff in the restaurants and the tune-up shop, the clothing store, to the lift operators, everyone is so professional and eager to assist in any way. Your lift operators are kind and helpful, especially to the skiers that are beginners. I felt safe and secure on every lift. In particular, there was one lift operator I’d like to give special recognition to, his name is Terry. He welcomed skiers to his lift, he joked with people and made the few seconds waiting for the chair lift, fun. I actually caught myself wanting to use just his lift, so that I could hear what he would say next. I could tell he loves people and loves his job. At all of the other ski hills I have been to, rarely are all the staff as courteous and helpful as yours. I think you all deserve big  Kudos for a job well done, and thank you for making my ski day extra fun!  Thanks again, I can’t wait to visit again!",5,positive
254637507,barrie/ca/154980/185603/254637507.html,Horseshoe Resort,"To get right to the problems: our main heating unit didn't work (in the winter, minus 40 degrees). Twice, front desk said they'd call the electrician, but he never received their calls. When he finally came (very late), he was aware that the heater was shorted out and unfixable. This suggests the resort knowingly placed us in a unsuitable room. The coffee maker didn't work either, but I cared less about that. We were freezing at night, in a supposedly ""renovated"" room.  The positive features still stand: the staff was really friendly, the food exceeded my expectations, the ski rentals were handled well, and the place was clean.   The main problems seemed to stem from communication breakdowns among staff.

We asked before what are the conditions for bringing a pet and was not told that there is a charge for it. Room looked fine until I proceeded to use the glasses and found that they were left dirty after being used by last person who stayed there. ( I noticed while drinking water out of them). snow was not clear of their adventure park and salt was not properly dropped so my dog could not go for a walk neither we could enjoy a walk. A 20$ burger kept up my fiance all night long and my wings went right into garbage as they came out raw. the next day we left the room so the cleaners can do their job. we came back to same sheets and ran out of shampoo while in the shower. The part that upset us the most was after bringing up our issues there was no response at all. all I have to say is , drive a little north by around 45 minutes and enjoy blue mountains.

The skiing was good, the equipment rental was almost brand-new.  They were some things that needed to be ironed out though. The swimming pool in the inn was too cold. It would have Been nice to have a heated pool. The hot tub had too many people in it, and there was no sign to limit the number of people in the hot tub. One hopes that there was enough chlorine in the hot tub.  The sitting area In the suite did not have enough furniture to be functional. The TV was in the wrong place; the TV should've been in the sitting area and not in front of the two beds.   The restaurant silk was a disappointment for me. I asked what the king cole duck was like on the menu and the waitress told me that it was duck confit. Ordered it thinking that I would be getting duck confit. When the duck arrived, it was not duck confit but seared duck breast. Nobody came to ask me if my meal was okay Until the end of the evening and we paid the bill. At that time I told the waitress that my meal was not Duck confit, to which she answered that the kitchen had the duck confit but they must've given me the wrong dish. The waitress did not offer to credit my bill with the price of the wrong meal. it appears that the service was very amateurish, as well as the meal and the quality of the food.  One of the highlights was the tubing. We had a very nice young man at the fourth row of the tubing hill who did excellent twists which my son loved. He told me his name was Ray the tubing guy. kudos to him for his good spirit!",3,negative

The trails and slopes were well-maintained, and in very good condition. the staff, for the most part, were helpful and friendly. The pool and gym were good, our room was clean and very adequate for our needs. BUT: We had trouble, as did others, with the heat. While not frigid in our room, it was cool (probably about 18 degrees C.). The heat pump was pumping out cool air. We asked and got a maintenance person to come, and we worked out that turning it off for a while, then back on, seemed to help. It did, for about an hour, then it resumed its pumping of cool air. At checkout, I asked if we could get a rebate on some of the cost of our visit. The desk person said they would email Erin, the manager. I heard nothing. So I phoned two days later, and the receptionist said she would also email Erin. I also emailed Erin directly. No response at all. I don't consider this to be good service for a major hospitality company. As well, the main restaurant in the hotel was closed, and we had to eat at the Roadhouse-style restaurant across the drive. One of the mains we asked for at dinner came in a portion size appropriate for a lunch, but at a price appropriate for a fancy dinner. Again, I commented, and we did not eat dinner there again. Average experience at best. I would look elsewhere the next time.",3,negative

So i called and asked what it was all about, they stated it was for the pool, parking etc. and wanted to keep it separate from the room total to show customers it was different for some reason or another, that is all fine and dandy but to include it suddenly at the very end is misleading and dishonest.

In addition, the shampoo dispenser was empty, remote control for bedroom tv does not work. Batteries in one of the remote, perhaps the dvd was all corroded. the wifi seem to disconnect every so often. You figured these would be covered when they charge you amenity fee!

Considering this is the only hotel, was hoping for a more grander entrance. The rooms were pretty good and the washrooms were nicely updated!  Having said this, there were some great things and some things that could be better. If this is a family resort, it must be geared to all ages, nothing for little ones to do except for swimming. No playroom/arcade. No coffee shop inside the hotel for my parents, and no microwave inside the room. This would have been very helpful for a family. I think Blue Mountain is better equipped for young families.  Thank goodness for one of the sweetest house cleaning lady (who I forgot her name), she went and got us a kettle and a microwave to help us out.  The skiing on the other hand was great. Opened till 10pm every night, and the guys in the ski rental were fantastic. The slopes were great and well lit. The tubing was absolutely amazing! The kids had a ball (except for the little one who wasn't tall enough to do anything).  One extra helpful tip....a Starbucks or Tim Hortons franchise on site would be helpful, especially since the closest one is 20-25 mins away!!!   All in all the family had a good time.",3,negative

261617722,barrie/ca/154980/185603/261617722.html,Horseshoe Resort,"We spent the first half of March Break, at Horseshoe Valley Resort. My parents are Skyline members, so we stayed in the Condos on the 5th floor. We had units 505 and 504. Both condos were completely renovated and gorgeous. I will say, however that the pull out couches were unbelievably uncomfortable. I could feel every spring in my back all night (We only slept on it the first night) and therefore tossed and turned. The other beds were VERY comfortable though. In the front bedroom, there are California shutters, which are gorgeous. The problem is, the exterior hall lights stay on all night and the shutters do not block it out very well. It was super bright in the room all night. It would be nice if there were also blackout blinds you could pull across. The kitchen was very nice but there is not enough storage. There is a small bar type area in an opening on one side, it would have been better if there was a pantry there. We found it difficult to find places to put our groceries. I was told that only the 5th floor has been renovated, hopefully the rest of the floors get renovated before we return next year. I would hate to think I am spending that money but getting a lesser experience. The first night we got there (a Saturday), there was a ski jump competition. What a GREAT event! They had fireworks starting at about 7:30 PM and it was a fun display. We loved sitting around the bonfires behind the chalet. It was so fun to kick back and watch the competition and the night time skiers.  There is a Beaver Tail stand behind the chalet. I have Celiac so I couldn't eat there, but my kids were super happy to see it! Staff there were very nice. Our kids took half-day ski/snow boarding lessons at the kid Korral and they had a fantastic time! I will say that my skier got more out of the lesson than my snowboarder though. There was a difficult child in her class who took most of the teacher's time so my daughter spent most of the time sitting down. There should have been another instructor in case of a situation like that. I probably wouldn't sign her up for that program again. My little skier, however loved it and wants to do a full day next time. The indoor pool is oddly tiny for such a large resort. I know there are outdoor pools in the summer, but in the winter we obviously couldn't use those. The pool was also painfully cold. Our lips were blue within 5 minutes of being in the water. We didn't get much use of the pool because of this and my kids found that disappointing. We went on a 4km snowshoe hike and that was SO much fun! It's hard work, so I wouldn't suggest it for kids under the age of 10. A great time though and we would do it again. Had a hard time connecting to wi-fi the whole time too. Connection was not very good at all. I found all the staff to be friendly and helpful. We would love to make this an annual trip! Hopefully all the kinks are worked out before we return next year. Maybe I can then update my rating to Excellent.

Half naked and wet, I had to move to my daughters bathroom to finish the shower.

Negative: customer services - hits and miss, the girl who check us in were friendly but the rest need to be helpful and knowledgeable with the resort and process.

I had to do a thorough clean because I don't want my 3 year old to get to them. There are no activity room, so other than swimming and hiking, there really isn't nothing to do. Everything else was closed for the season.  We checked out early and at first the customer service insisted I have to pay extra to leave early ... anyway, after a few explanation and waiting for a different person to call me back we were clear to go.

The hotel and common area seemed pretty dated with bubbling, cracked, peeling paint. (For what the hotel is, I still can't believe how much they charge per night). As for charging $10 per person to ride the trails, that's understandable if the resort has to do a lot of extra work to keep them well kept but it seems as if that should be included in the resort fee. It would be nice if that charge is absorbed by destination riders. Perhaps it's a Canadian thing? The staff was not very accommodating for our breakfast situation so we had to go to a grocery store to buy oatmeal for the room. We were going to be charged $15/person to eat toast and oatmeal morning of the race. The manager told us they don't do a la carte even though they knew we are racing right in the middle of breakfast time (we would miss the closing of breakfast and it didn't open early enough to eat a big breakfast before the race).  At check-in, we asked for a late checkout and were told to call in the morning to request a noon checkout. Per their request, I called at 7am for a late checkout and subsequently had our door knocked on 2 times: 11:10am and 11:30am to see if we had vacated the room. I was so annoyed that we left the room at 11:40 (this review would have been written from the resort while waiting for awards ceremony but again, the internet wouldn't work). As for the rooms, the AC barely worked and the bathroom didn't have an exhaust fan to use after a hot shower which made the room more stuffy. The nice thing about the rooms was that they were quiet and the bed was comfortable. It was also big enough for all of our equipment. We did play mini-golf and that was a lot of fun. Nice clean course that flowed well.  Wish I had more nice things to say about the resort but I can't think of anything",3,negative

It was a guest who let us know about the one across the street, not a staff member. The Adventure Park was very disappointing. The zip line was not working, but there was no offer of a substitute, such as archery, and no discount if you bought the package. As well, the reality compared to the website was extremely cheesy. Not worth the price at all, except for the bungy. However, we had to wait and wait and got short shrift on the jump. All the staff here were ill trained and had no people skills. They were far more interested in talking to each other. Dinner at the Crazy Horse was very good and breakfast was fine. Both waitresses were very good.

Remember to bring your own glasses etc. if you are planning on entertaining as only 4 water glasses were in the room. We were not impressed with the breakfast brunch offered at the hotel. It was overpriced and did not have a lot of choices. Now for the wedding itself....the ceremony was here as well as the reception. It was a beautiful venue for an outdoor wedding, and the tented area for the reception was excellent. The thing I was most impressed with was the food served at the buffet.

We left the kids and were looking for a night away. The resort is good not great. Our room had been renovated since our last visit and it was good. TV did not work but service guy fixed it up. Outdoor pool was not open which was unfortunate. It opens end of June. Indoor pool looks like it was once great but needs some work. Sauna is a little rough around the edges. We had lunch at the Crazy Horse. It was enjoyable bar type food. Drinks on the patio. Enjoyed it. We've had dinner at Silks in the past and enjoyed it before but the sun was out so we ate at the Crazy horse for dinner and it's just OK for dinner. But it was a beautiful day and we had more drinks so it was fun non the less. Overall I would recommend the resort and the new adventure part really has a lot to offer. Don't expect Toronto type 5 star amenities or rooms. It's just not that level of place but it's pretty good. We didn't golf this time but it's a nice golf course.

We entered our room and put drinks in the fridge so they would be cold to take with us to adventure park (which is a joke for a 13 yr old girl and 15 yr old boy) then settled in to watch on command which I asked about during booking our stay and was assured we could rent a movie, well that didn't work cause it was not working in the hotel nor did the fridge work.

We are all between 18-22 years of age so we like to have fun. When we got there we walked through Adventure Park and we were pretty disappointed. The website sounded like there was a lot more to do for ""kids"" our age but it was for kids 14 and under. It was also pretty upsetting when I called to confirm that the ogo balls were still available (wasn't shown online) and I was told yes, turns out they weren't.  One of the ladies at the front desk was also extremely rude and kept informing me that there are quiet hours at 11 pm and they will not tolerate any sort of noise.

289088411,barrie/ca/154980/185603/289088411.html,Horseshoe Resort,"My son and I came on a quiet Monday in early July to explore the Adventure park. We arrived in the early afternoon, and we're able to check in right away. The room was very nice—had been renovated fairly recently. Quite likely the bathroom, which was fitted with a new shower instead of a tub. The TV only had ""on demand"" pay movies, and not at full HD. We bought the adventure package so we got one ride on the thrilling zip line. We had a Groupon for the next day with 2 zip line rides each, so we were excited for that. The rest of the activities were only so-so. We did as much as we could without paying extra for bike, Segway, etc. rentals. So that's mini-golf (a good course terraced into the hill), an inflatable obstacle course (targeted for little kids, but my 15 year old did it anyway), rock climbing tower, which I found challenging, a maze — that had check points spelling M-A-Z-E that lacked a means of marking your ""passport"", and supposedly a system for timing your course that was busted. We also did archery, with funny safety arrows with giant marshmallow-like safety pads on the tips of the arrows that made them not very aerodynamic. Generally we felt like doing each of these activities once was about it. Doing a second day would require some rentals for it to be fun. We arrived at the paddle boats at 5:45 and were told that they were closing it. The pools were quite nice, though I agree that the indoor pool does look quite dated and a little tired. The outdoor pool was a great temperature. There was a squash court that we chose not to explore.  As for restaurants, there were only two available for dinner—The Inn and Crazy Horse. Silks is now only open for breakfast. We chose the Inn, and had a great meal looking out on the hills of the ski resort. Delicious, well prepared food, similar to say The Keg in style and quality, though I imagine they would like to be more up market than that. Lovely server.  The air conditioning system in our room was very noisy, but the beds were great. We slept pretty well. Breakfast was the buffet at Silks, which had good quality items, which you would expect when you pay that much for breakfast. I've spoiled with free hotel breakfasts, so paying $15 for a breakfast seems like a lot, but isn't really all that bad, and the quality is much better than those free ones!  In the morning it threatened to thunderstorm (which it did) so we decided that we would save our groupon for another day this summer and return for more adventures then.",4,positive

Room-  Pros-Very large with full kitchen (all amenities) 2 bedrooms, 2 bathrooms, washer, dryer, dining room, living room, fireplace, veranda. Beds were comfortable. Linens in master bedroom were good, great towels.   Cons- not renovated since the 80's...which normally would have been fine...but for $430/night? Not okay. Cleanliness 5/10 not sure if bad housekeeping or if everything was just so old and used. Linens in second bedroom were old and dated, as was all furniture, drapes and decor.  We had visited someone else during the event the year before that rented a place, and theirs was freshly renovated and modern...that is what I was expecting,and why I was willing to pay a premium so I was surprised and disappointed when I saw the state of the place we were given.

290927928,barrie/ca/154980/185603/290927928.html,Horseshoe Resort,"I stayed here over a weekend in July of 2015 where I was attending a wedding. I stay in hotels quite frequently and stay in everything from Motel 6's to the Four Seasons. Ultimately, an experience boils down to: 1) What are you paying for? 2) Did you get it? At Horseshoe I didn't feel like I got what I paid for. Ultimately, I would say if there is an event like a wedding or conference you are going to at the resort, I would say it's probably worth biting the bullet and staying on-site as the other places in the vicinity are a little awkward to get to. However, if you are looking for a romantic getaway I would, unfortunately, say you should probably look elsewhere unless you get a great deal on a package. Here's a run-down of my experience.  PROS:  -Parking was included in the price, and was close to the hotel. (Parking was outdoor) -Wireless internet was included in the price and there was no password or hassle to connect. (My guess is, since the property is somewhat isolated people don't steal the signal.) -Pictures of room from the website were fairly accurate. -Linen was white (you can see stains if there are any, and if something is stained, it can be bleached to fully remove the stain/germs-- I used to work as a chambermaid.) -Toiletries included separate conditioner (not a 2 in 1), although not very good conditioner.  CONS:  -Resort fee is upwards of $60. (!!!) Seriously! This is whether or not you use the adventure park/golf course/pool, or not. -Sheets on the bed were scratchy -I forgot a razor, and when I called the front desk they told me I would have to buy one from a vending machine on the other side of the hotel for $5! For the price, I would expect toiletries like this to be included AND be brought to your room. -No complimentary breakfast. The breakfast buffet is a step above a standard continental breakfast, but not worth $15 plus tip. -No room in the mini-bar for outside food or drink.  -Room seemed like it had been partially renovated, but it wasn't a full overhaul, and the room showed a lot of wear. There were still popcorn ceilings, lots of black scuffs on the wall (probably from skis in the winter), the carpet showed a lot of wear, electrical outlets were so overused that my phone charger kept falling out, etc. -Room was oddly appointed. The phone sat on a very short table, on a wall with no other furniture. Talking on it required bending over, or sitting on the floor. The phone had no buttons to automatically connect you to different places in the hotel. It also took me a while to find the full length mirror, which was on the back of the bathroom door. Not where I wanted to have to go to dress for a formal event (water stains on clothes, etc.)  -Window's that look out on to the golf course are quite lovely, but are not at all tinted, so there are golfers putting 10-20 feet from your room.

Yes it is quite pricey, however they offer a range of outdoor activities that can keep the whole family entertained. I liked the pool options, one indoor and two outdoor. We had a great time. The best option is to buy the adventure package, instead of paying for each activity separately. There are several areas for improvement though and the hotel should definitely look into offering a higher quality experience. First, it appears the resort is understaffed. In many instances there were no staff or not enough staff manning most activities. The rock climbing was one good example. Housekeeping was very poorly done. Our room was not vacuumed and the furniture was not cleaned. It was still quite dusty after every housekeeping visit. There were stains in our sheets and the beds were very poorly made, especially on the second day. The reception quality on the television was quite poor. The dining options were very limited and quite pricey plus there were flies in the restaurants. Finally the gym was a joke - I am not sure if they call it a gym. It seemed like it was simply a room with exercise equipment that was abandoned. The room had no windows and no ventilation, very unappealing. Despite all of that, my family had a really great time.

She assisted our group in the evening and was very accommodating to our needs. Tina is very thoughtful and spoke highly of Horseshoe Valley Resort and Skyline. - Just wanted to pass on.  On another note, reception upon arrival was not very attentive. I was arriving with parcels for our meeting and they had no staff to assist with luggage or parcels. The lady was all by herself. I was told to use a cart and bring my things in. I figured my room wouldn't be ready. To wait at reception for over 10 mins to have my bags locked up was unreal. Then the door was opened and she didn't tell me I had to put my bags away myself. I didn't feel that the lock up was secure, so I put my bags in a colleagues room.  My room was 333 the air conditioning barely worked. I had it cranked and it would not get the humidity down. Many of my colleagues had the same experience.   I did notice mid day walking to my room a couple of times that a lot of peoples room doors were open. Similar if you know someone is coming you gently leave the door open, it doesn't fully close. Then I saw workers going in and out, I guess for repairs. This did not make me feel safe to leave my belongings in the room, so I declined house keeping and didn't tell anyone about my a/c issue. I did open the windows one night. The windows are filthy. I can understand dust and construction. People want to look out the window and see nature, it's one of your biggest assets!   The Chef did a brilliant job with our meals. The morning Breakfast attendant was awesome, sorry I forget his name, really nice guy and accommodating! Everything was his pleasure!

The rooms are outdated and to my amazement, our room had what seemed like a 27"" flat screen TV. The TV reception was fuzzy. I thought I was looking at a TV from my childhood. You know the ones with ""Rabbit Ears"".   It was the first resort or hotel for that matter that I have been to, that didn't have towels at the pool. We had to go back up to our room and get a couple of our bath towels. It also had a women's and men's change room that looked like something from the 70's.   WiFi was sporadic and it didn't reach the pool area.

298291496,barrie/ca/154980/185603/298291496.html,Horseshoe Resort,"First let's start with the positve.. We arrived early and they were able to accomodate us and got us into our room 2 hours early which was greatly appreciated. The rooms themselves are nicely upgraded and are very clean. The bathrooms are also very nicely upgraded with a nice walk-in glass shower. We got an adventure pass included with our room but you have to choose which day of your stay that you use it. You can't split it over your stay which can be inconvenient especially when the weather is inclement like it was for us. My 11 year olds enjoyed that and the ziplining was the highlight. I would suggest that they should have a few more activities for older kids that don't cost hundreds of dollars and are included in the adventure pass.   Now for the negative- the resort itself needs some serious upgrades with the pool areas. We went across to the condo pool as you are able to use that and the condition of the pool and pool area was quite poor. The pool itself was not clean and the chairs were covered in dirt and debris. The hottub over there was no where near hot enough. We did not stay over there long. Even the indoor pool and hottub area in the main area of the hotel could use some updating. You also have to go to the front desk to get towels which I don't understand. They have only one person working the front counter and on several occasions we had to stand there and wait up to 10 minutes while they took reservations on the phone. A tip to anyone coming here. Bring your own towels!! The ones they give you are no bigger than a hand towel and are very scratchy and thin. They give you one towel which did not even go around my waist and i am not a big woman. They need some new and bigger towels and should keep the towels in the locker room area to make it easier for guests. There are limited food choices for young kids on site and it is very expensive. We ended up driving 15 minutes into Barrie to eat dinner and saved ourselves a tonne of money. The activities are great, but be prepared to spend a tonne of extra money. $60 for 45 min horse ride. For a family of four- that is $240 for 45 minutes. A bit ridiculous. Same with the treetop trekking- $200 for a family of four. I would also suggest that they need to speak to the staff who are operating the adventure park activities. There were lineups because they had limited staff to oversee the activities. My son was on the euro-bungy and the staff member who was supposed to be observing spent the whole time on her smartphone. I doubt that is what they are supposed to be doing. Overall we had an okay trip but probably would not return for the quality of the resort and the price of the rooms.

The breakfast at Silks was great but the food at the Crazy Horse and the Inn Steakhouse was AWFUL.  We golfed the Highlands - great course. Ziplined - was ok. Loved the Segway Copeland Forest tour. Indoor pool area was dirty and in need of a good scrub.  Good resort for families of small children if you are not fussy. Couples STAY AWAY.
 
 
 Room Tip:  If you HAVE to stay here ask for a room at the end of the hall.

300076570,barrie/ca/154980/185603/300076570.html,Horseshoe Resort,"I stayed with my two teenage daughters for a night. The front desk staff was very friendly and our room was very nicely decorated, incorporating some woodsy finishes into a modern theme. The bathroom with glass shower and stone countertop was clean and spacious. The only complaint to be made was the poor TV picture quality. A more user-friendly movie option would have been great. Dinner at the Crazy Horse was good, but not outstanding (I have, however, dined at Silks before, and it's terrific!). I recommend staying here for anyone wanting to have a family fun weekend at the Adventure Park, a ski break or to golf.

But for a Thurs/Frid/sat night stay for a wedding at $398 a night - NO WAY - a light bulb out in main mirror bathroom called and changed it and left the box to prove it, crap tv channels, analog, not HD, movies did not work, they stole furniture from the bottom room I guess for a nice youth conference and replaced with 2 small chairs and a tiny table. With a big vacant space. The AC was so erratic and we were in 30 degree C humidity high, the wifi was so poor in our room too. I complained on check out and told, you should have let us have a chance to correct it, so your problem. I no internet stuff and they need a new server…so I am pretty sure that would not happen at the time of my stay. Um, excuse me….did you see the price tag? Why should I do the work for you…when i get a room at that price just for a wedding stay over and not use any pool, fitness, adventure stuff…I think a great tv channel and some nice AC and internet would make me really really satisfied. I will never recommend this hotel. If it was $119….well, you get what you pay for. Go stay at the Hampton Suites in Barrie. At least you get a free breakfast. Oh yes, you also pay for your breakfast. Get out of the dark ages Barrie/Horseshoe.

Wifi never worked the whole time I was there..super annoyed. Food was okay. It was pre packaged and you could tell. The spa was lovely though. I highly recommend a massage! I wouldn't recommend this hotel for work purposes because it's in the middle of nowhere. If you want to get away tho it is nice and secluded.

302888534,barrie/ca/154980/185603/302888534.html,Horseshoe Resort,"It hurts too much to bring back the memory of that one night recently spent at Horseshoe so this will be brief. The central accommodation.... a building erected in the early 80's not well designed from the get-go. No patios even for rooms on the ground level, no balconies - in a gorgeous area with beautiful views but you can't sit outside your room unless you leave it. The only restaurant in the 'hotel' is exclusively for private or corporate groups and there's no room service! You have to leave the building to the bar across the road to get a drink unless you've had the foresight to bring your own in which case, again, you'll be drinking it inside your room, not on your patio or balcony. And Ontario's ""Nanny"" laws won't allow you to walk with a drink in your hand anywhere outside a licensed establishment. Fortunately, we were given a gift of a bottle of wine at an off-site, unrelated event so when we returned with it, we snuck 2 plastic chairs from the outdoor (uninspired, basic, dated) pool, and hiding under darkness of night, placed them in a secluded, hidden area and have a couple of glasses of wine. THIS IS NOT RESORT SERVICE. And don't get us started on the silverfish in the shower. That this is owned by a large hotel chain is interesting. While on the one hand you'd expect that they'd want to revamp the set up, decor, service, etc., they don't see to care much. If you've got little kids with you, you could suck it up as they do offer some fun, if limited activities. But you'd better prefer for the lack of.... well... a lot of comforts and bring your own.

303349831,barrie/ca/154980/185603/303349831.html,Horseshoe Resort,"We stayed two nights at the Horseshoe Resort. Frist some good things. The golf course was beautiful and very well maintained. The staff at the pro shop and at the starter's area were really helpful and good natured. the wait staff at the breakfast were also professional and attentive. Unfortunately there were a few areas that let the place down. Silks, their fine dining restaurant was closed, so only option was keg style, fast food eating. The staff at the front desk on arrival were cool and pretty uninterested.   We arrived early, they said come back at 2pm, we did, then they said no rooms, come back at 4pm. we said we had been told to come back at 2, and miraculously after a bit of huffing around a room became available. if the hotel had to fix only one thing, I think it would be the welcome on arrival, a smile or two, friendliness and a bit of interest in the guest. guests are the ones who are actually arriving, paying and ultimately providing the money to pay things like receptionists wages. might be an idea to cater to the customer a bit more. Having said that, later in the evening, a different receptionist recommended a restaurant, booked it and gave us good directions. highs and lows of service.  the receptionist also told us we had to pay for golf carts in our package deal, but then the golf shop said it was all included - a bonus for us, but something the receptionist should have known. it's again something they could focus on in their greeting, rather than grump around insisting the carts had to be paid for. Also, I paid upfront for the package, through the hotel's website. when I explained upon booking that I wanted to pay in local currency, the receptionist assured me they could reverse the charge on the credit card when i checked out and then I could pay in local money. on check out, that wasn't possible. a small thing, but again highlighted the limited training the staff have. an area that could be greatly improved for big benefits.  the rooms are big and renovated nicely, but they smell damp and musty. the air con hammered away, as did the coffee machine 24/7 always at the ready. (Canadians do a lot of great things, but coffee is not one of them.)   the cleaners need a bit of perking, too. They looked sloppy, tired and like they were going through the motions. I am sure they do an excellent job, but again it is about presentation in the hotel game. everybody from management to cleaners need to look sharp and on the ball if you want customers to feel like they want to return. this is an area where the hotels stumbles.  Our view of the 18th green was great and the room had big windows with the ability to open the screens a little bit for fresh air.  overall, I would probably return to this hotel as the golf was great, but it needs some staff training and a bit of work on freshening up the rooms.

There were three different pools you could use so make sure you check them all out before you choose one - we liked the outdoor pool nearest the hotel but there is another outdoor pool overlooking the ski hills and another indoor pool in the hotel. The restaurant was good pub food (burgers) but not a lot of selection so if you're okay with a beer and burger you'll probably be just fine. Mini golf is built on the side of a hill where you'd never expect it to be and it was a blast! Some really fun and challenging holes. The full golf course was also a good time with great service. The view from the top of the 18th hole is beautiful (and would be great in the fall!) so make sure to bring a camera.  Rent Segways from Segway of Ontario Off-Road Adventure if you can as they are located on the property and an absolute blast!

Close to Toronto. The boys were 15 years old and most resort activities are more geared to the younger kids, but we still managed to find lots to do. The outdoor pools could be cleaned a little more often because there were lots of bugs in them. Thankfully Horseshoe is renovating because it was long over due. Rooms are basic, but clean. For the better part the resort area is kept clean. We enjoyed our stay and would definitely refer this place to friends.

We booked over the phone, and despite calling twice, never received email confirmation as promised. Additionally on the bill was a resort fee added on check-out which was never disclosed to me at the time of booking.  While the rooms were lovely in terms of decor, there were a few things that were disappointing:  - the room was very dusty, and looked like it hadnt been dusted in weeks. Being asthmatic it was not a pleasant environment to be in. I will note the bathroom was very clean. - the A/C and fridge was exceptionally noisy and kept us up most of the night.  - the complimentary wifi was terrible, I couldnt even log on to the Horseshoe Valley resort website to check the menus for the restaurants. This was on both an iPhone and iPad. - the pillows were incredibly hard and uncomfortable. Both my spouse and I ended up sleeping without pillows as it was more comfortable, and both had sore necks the next morning.  In addition to that:  - No vending machines were working so in order to have some water for the night, we went to Silks to ask for a glass or bottle. The staff member was rude and seemed put out by such an easy request.  - In the morning when we went to use the gym, we were shocked to discover there was no a/c in it, only a small fan in one corner of the room. Being one of the hottest and most humid days of the summer, it was difficult to work out in those conditions and after 5 minutes we gave up.  - My spouse made an appointment for a 60 minute Swedish massage at 10am on the Sunday morning. It turned out the receptionist had booked the appointment incorrectly for 9am and his appointment could then not be accommodated.

The park appears to be for smaller children when it comes to the obstacle course and bungy trampoline not allowing access for my 13 year old because of size and weight restrictions. As adults my wife and I were a little disappointed because when reading the brochure we were enticed by these particular attractions and looked forward to checking them out. Activities on the outside were fairly abundant but once the park close down for the night there is practically nothing to do on the inside. The pool is reasonable in size but not deep enough for the older kids and adults. We found the room to be okay but it was not the cleanest and there was absolutely nothing on the televison. We had a good time in the park itself and will consider going again but the room was very costly for the night and had nothing to offer other that sleep.

310238567,barrie/ca/154980/185603/310238567.html,Horseshoe Resort,"I booked the family vacation from 7/20-7/23 with the adventure pack after reading their marketing material and the pictures looked like it was a lot of fun. However it is not the case and now I know why most of the pictures on the marketing material are close up shots. We arrived early but cannot check in until 4 and that is standard. We had time to walk around and we walked into the adventure park. The bike barn wasn't open when we got there at 1pm Monday and we saw the children's play fort near the entrance. The play fort is so small that my neighbourhood play park is bigger than that. We eventually checked in at 4pm and I was told that we are staying at the building across from the main hotel. I got the ground floor 2 bedroom with full kitchen and that building looked like it is in dire need of repairs and renovations. The room itself looked nothing like the picture it showed on the internet, it is old and it didn't feel clean. The dining room table felt sticky despite scrubbing it with dish soap, the patio door lock is hanging and doesn't lock, one of the bathrooms has a leaky faucet at the shower and puddle of water is on the bathroom floor. The bathroom sink is also leaking so we called the front desk which they sent a maintenance person to fix. The maintenance person came and said he is a electrician but was sent here to fix the faucets. He managed to fix the shower faucet but informed us that the bathroom sink faucet needs replacing and suggested that we don't use it. There are bike trails but family bike trails are non existence, the gem stone mining at the adventure park is basically buying a bag of sand with gen stones inside, and dumping it thru the running water trough till all the sand is washed away. Pony ride was good but was quoted a different price when we asked the staff before buying the tickets. Paddle boat was in a very small pond with no scenery. Zip lining was decent, Climbing wall has loose foot holds. We didn't do the maze or the hummer tour, tree top trekking was decent but no different than any other tree top trekking places. Swimming pool was ok but no life jackets available for little kids as other partons had mentioned that they did have life jackets for little kids years ago. You cannot cheap out on safety! There is a squash court but didn't see any racquets.There is a restaurant in the main hotel but didn't see anyone in there, there are 2 restaurants there and only 1 was open. No coffee shops or convenience stores so you can either buy it from their vending machines at the hotel or stock up in Collingwood before getting there. I later found out that the top floor rooms in the building I stayed in were renovated, so just a heads up to those booking to ask for the renovated rooms and not get stuck with the room like ours on the ground floor. Not sure if there is a price difference but what I paid was definitely not worth it.  On the 2nd day there I've decided to extend the vacation by booking into Blue Mountain Resort after the stay at Horseshoe is over, so we stayed till the end and got out of there as soon as we can and checked into Blue Mountain for 4 days 3 nights. It was a wonderful experience at Blue and was night and day compared to Horseshoe Resort. To top it off, Blue Mountain Resort was even cheaper with a lot more free activities. It is definitely not worth the money at Horseshoe compared to what Blue had to offer.

The decor has not been touched in decades, and it's very tired. This building is also right beside the pool and the two main restaurants, which made for very loud people in close proximity to my room, so it was very difficult to fall asleep. The rowdy guests are not the fault of the hotel, however, and it was probably just bad luck.   On the plus side, the rooms are enormous, tons of space - two bathrooms, two bedrooms, and full kitchen and laundry. They just desperately need updating/renovating, and more soundproof windows.   The food at all the restaurants was very good.

It was very nicely decorated with what looked like new carpeting, new drapes, nice furnishings and stainless steel appliances. There was 2 bedrooms, 2 bathrooms, kitchen area, dining area, living room area and an enclosed patio that overlooked the pool. The master bath had 2 sinks and a double shower. The other bathroom had tub. The kitchen had all the equipment needed to make meals - would be a great place for a family to stay. The only thing I found odd is that the paint needs to be touched up in places - perhaps they were mid-reno when we stayed - this wasn't a big deal for us. Wi-fi worked well.",4,positive

The property is well kept and the rooms were very comfortable. We booked a spa package and I would guess that in most cases it is a couple that book that together as they had us booked in a room with a king bed...not what we had in mind. The front desk staff were friendly and efficient in changing our booked to accommodate our two bed request. There were two weddings while we were at the resort and I am glad to say that at o time was the noise out of control even though the event took place practically under our window. We ate at the Cazy Horse restaurant the first night, the food was good and so was the service. Prices were acceptable and we did not feel as though we were paying too much. The spa staff were super. We booked one thing and asked for last minute changes and they did their best to accommodate our request. They were not able to fulfill all our requests but made significant effects too and did achieve satisfying our wants to the best of their abilities.  That said my only disappointment was with some of the spa services. We booked an entire spa day package which included lunch.  LUXURY SPA DAY  Choice of RMT Swedish Massage OR Body Therapy Guinot Classic Facial with complimentary skin analysis  Custom Manicure Custom Pedicure Spa Lunch & Mimosa  Massage was great, we upgraded to a Shizen Signature Massage, which I highly recommend to everyone! From this we had the facial, I will admit disappointment, I felt it was old fashion and I left feeling as though I had a ton of moisturizer on my face. This is not what I am used to but remember having by his type of facial in years gone by. Then we were served lunch, the food was great but who wants to eat in the mani pedi room! This was actually the most disappointing moment of the entire weekend. The mani and pedi were mediocre but acceptable.  Please do not think this is a bad review because it is not. We would return to this resort but would drastically change our spa choices and maybe only have the massage and a pedi.",4,positive

Seriously, the paint on the ceiling is all peeling, the wallpaper is peeling, the carpet is stained *everywhere* - the closets are missing doors, everything seems sticky and dirty, the room stinks like old cigarettes. Nothing has been updated since the 70's, the room has extremely rusty nasty old wall heaters.  I thought I was paying resort fees for a really nice large room, but ended up in a cheap off-the-highway roach motel.  The receptionist was kind, but a smile only goes so far when you're getting ripped off hard core for a complete crap hole.

I truly thought that there would be something offered that would be an enticement to having paid a resort fee. Turns out that we are between seasons and there was nothing here at all during our stay. Except of course, the mini golf that they wanted to charge $24 for the two of us to play a game. The hallways were filthy dirty, there was renovation products sitting on the floor in the hallways and painters going from room to room. The hallways had a paint or glue odour. Our room which apparently had a ""courtyard"" view was actually a view of a stone driveway and rock cut. We were not notified that on top of our room charge there was a $100 PER NIGHT incidental fee that was charged to our MasterCard. Not sure about you but the spending money we had was to enjoy while we were away, instead, we were limited to doing anything at all because they held the $200. The young lady in the morning didn't even know the area and could not recommend where to go for small town shopping/gift shops etc. At this point I would not recommend and would not return.

The front desk person was not very welcoming, the room was tired (ie. badly repaired water damage on ceiling, 1 thin duvet on the bed and pillows that ressembled big rocks!). The bathroom was nice though and the best part of the room. We asked for a trail map at the front desk and headed out for a hike on the ""Farm Loop."" Although we found the beginning of the trail it went downhill from there.....no trail markers....paths going off in all different directions! We ended up somehow making a loop of our own and ended up back at the car after 20 minutes (hardly the 4 km we where hoping for) and decided to to chance heading back out on the trail as it was getting quite late. We did not use the pool area but it did look nice and the Adventure Park looks like fun for the kiddies if we ever come back. I think that for families who are there to be busy it would be better.

You don't need the commitment of signing up for the whole season (can usually book a few days beforehand) and it is very reasonably priced. The instructors are fantastic as well.  The hills aren't great for adults - but that isn't why we go. The tubing is also quite a bit of fun.   In terms of the resort itself - it is ok. It is a bit dated in areas, but the rooms are ok and the pool is fun for the kids after a day on the slopes. The atmosphere and food in the Crazy Horse is pretty good. Overall food is a bit pricey for the value - but it's a ski resort so that is pretty much standard.   Overall - if you are an avid skiier this isn't the spot for you. If you're looking for something like the Village at Blue Mountain - this probably won't work either. However, if you're looking for a great spot for your kids to learn how to ski and enjoy a family weekend it's a pretty good spot.",3,negative

The resort is under major construction still and it is the start of their busy Winter season. The main hotel which we were booked in has completed some renovations, stills feels a bit out of date. When I booked I called directly to inquire about the different rooms, condos and packages available for the Dec 4th wknd, which is their official Winter kickoff wknd. The prices seem pretty high for the condos and I was informed there are newly renovated ones at an additional $100.00 per night if I wished. As it was just the 2 of us, it was suggested I book one of the Studio suites with a king bed, these are usually reserved for wheel chair accessible guests, as the room has lower amenities and a full walk in shower. I agreed as it was the only King bed option. The room was nice and big and we didn’t mind the big open shower, but the hotel had been booked for a local hockey tournament. To our surprise we were located with a whole group of them. It would have been nice if when I booked the attendant had mentioned that most of the hotel was booked for this! The other disappointment was the confusing way the Hiking/cross country trails were marked and there was no one in site to ask at the beginning of the trails. Luckily we went out early enough that we were able to find our way back before dark. Unfortunately we did not get to experience the snow activities due to the lack of snow, but we cannot complain about that. We made the best of it and used the pool/hot tub and hiking trails. One a good note, the buffet breakfast was fantastic as well as dinner in both restaurants, the INN Steakhouse and the Crazy Horse. I’m not sure I’d go back, but I’d really to find a great location to do snowshoeing/cross country skiing at close to the city.",3,negative

337629628,barrie/ca/154980/185603/337629628.html,Horseshoe Resort,"My wife and I were generally disappointed in our 3 day stay at Horseshoe Resort. We were on the ground floor of the Inn, facing away from the slopes. The room was average and seemed to be ""tired"" with some of the furniture looking like it had been recycled from more renovated rooms. We were probably assigned this room because we used a third party booking site this time for our reservation. It almost seemed like we were being punished for not booking direct with the resort. We had stayed at the resort two years ago and it seemed to be more popular at that time. Lack of snow over Christmas 2015 was no doubt affecting the resort operations. It seemed that many of the building were under permanent construction this time. We did have dinner in the dining room which was pleasant and lunch at the Crazy Horse but aside from that we avoided using the resort for meals. There was no place just to have a small snack. As a last resort we might consider staying here again but the impression we were left with is that the resort wants to get out of the short term guests business and focus all its attention on timeshare guests. This is fine but management must make up its mind because the rates being charged, including the resort fees, do not seem to justify the accommodation and services being provided to a guest who simply wants to have a room for the night.

We have in the past found Horseshoe Resort to be a great place to go. This year we rented one of the upgraded condos. We were disappointed with the minor facelift. These particular condos are on the 5th floor internet was spotty there was no ppv offered on the 5th floor only standard cable - normally it wouldn't be a problem but with no snow there wasn't much to do. Disappointed with the patch job done on the cheap to these units - fireplaces can no longer be used but next year they will install gas fireplaces in these units-why not now-replacing the furniture would have been a good idea - tired old sofa covered with stains. The pool was cold hot tub barely warm and packed -due to weather with parents walking around inside in dirty outdoor boots. Pool towels should have been replaced years ago. Will say we enjoyed the steakhouse better then Silks. Very sad to see everything dated and what has been replaced is economy minded rather then what it once was. Staff tried hard to please.

Not a great first impression. Called the front desk and spoke with Jessica who was excellent. Apologized several times and sent someone with a key to another room on the same floor right away(3-5 minutes). The next room was clean so we started getting settled. The room was spacious, nicely updated, great kitchen, comfortable couch, nice beds and a large area right by the front door to store our skis, boots, jackets etc (although I think they intend to turn it into a small bedroom with bunk beds which would be a bad idea as there is no place for skis or bikes otherwise). The fireplace has a sign that they are converting the old wood fireplaces to natural gas so we couldn't use it which was disappointing as it is advertised as having a fireplace. The unit has an unheated patio overlooking the ski hill. The sliding doors leading to it from the master bedroom and sitting area are drafty. The exterior windows are ancient and fogged badly basically obscuring an otherwise fantastic view of the ski hill. I hope they intend to replace them as it would make a significant improvement. Tubing was fun, but we were accidentally overcharged. Crazy horse restaurant was also excellent but again we were overcharged.

When I checked out, I got a sneer from the agent when i insisted I would not pay $15.99 for a movie I couldn't watch. Never mind he disappointment from my son when he couldn't watch the movie he was looking forward to. No apologies from this staff. They are too busy just being ignorant. Horseshoe Resort is definitely a place to stay away from. Only bright spot was the skiing...it was okay. Blue Moubtain gets my business from here on...stay away from this terrible resort rip off.",1,negative

Then we had no hot water in the shower - for the whole time we were there! When we reported it to the front desk, they said they'd send someone to fix it but did nothing. Luckily, we were with friends and could shower in their room...but seriously? Finally, I asked for a late checkout due to a spa appointment...then when we asked about compensation for the lack of hot water, they said, ""Oh, your late checkout was your compensation.""

As everyone knows it is difficult when first learning the basics of how to snowboard and you do often fall. My dad had fallen getting off of the lift and instead of slowing down the lift so that he had time to get out of the way the staff came out and were screaming ""Get the hell out of the way"" as he was trying to get up. Later on in the day my Dad had cut his finger pretty badly and it was bleeding quite a bit on the hill. I asked 2 different ski patrollers if they had a band aid, the first one just flat out said no and the other one said he'd maybe try and find us one but then just continued to snowboard and never tried to find one. I thought that it was the job of the ski patrollers to try and help someone if they are hurt yet both were more interested in snowboarding at their leisure. I then went to the bottom of the lift and asked the people checking tickets if they had one or could find one in a first aid kit, they too said that they didn't have one. I find it a bit ridiculous that the staff either don't have band-aids or knew where to find one but also don't have access to a first aid kit. I will no longer be telling friends or family to go skiing or snowboarding at Horseshoe Valley Ski Resort as I was very unimpressed with the staff.",1,negative

I called ahead of time to ask and was told that although they could not guarantee that they would do everything they could do accommodate early check in.  We arrived at 1:30 and were told room not ready and they would see what they could do. I mentioned that I did not care what type of room because it was important to get in so we can change and go skiing because we know rain was coming and we had purchased ski tickets!!.  We asked again a few time but no room and we saw many people come in and get checked in immediately!!!  At 3:45pm I went and asked again and was told if we switch rooms we can go in now!!! seriously at 345 when they guaranteed 4pm check in. That made me very unhappy specifically when I told them that I did not care about room type.  In any case went in changed and then skid for 1/2 hour and guess what Rain!!!!  My point is when I was telling them that I did not care about room type but that we needed to get in so we can ski and get changed etc and then at 345 to offer a different room. I mean we were waiting right near the front desk. Every time I went up to them its like I was completely new and they did not know who I was.

We had an amazing experience right from the moment we got into the parking lot. The food in the crazy horse was delicious also but the most memorable thing that happened during our day trip was at the Quad lift. My son, 5, was having trouble getting up to the load line before getting knocked down by the chair almost every time we loaded. The girl working the lift, who I later asked her name, Jamie, quickly recognized this and helped get our son up to the line and picked him up onto the seat every single time we loaded. This small gesture made our experience so much better. Without her help we wouldn't have been able to load as quickly and would have held up the crazy line behind us. I am sure this is just a typical part of her day at work but it made my day at Horseshoe 110% better.

The ski hills were a lot of fun for beginners like me. They were easy to learn on and over whelming.

Wanted to sit by the fire place but it was freezing by the exterior wall and the fireplace did not give off much heat. Wifi was really weak so we couldn't even watch a movie on our potable devices.

Room was clean and modern. One issue we had was that the day before I got an email to ""Check in Now"". It asked our time of arrival (which would be between 9:00 a.m. and 10:00 a.m.), and where we would like our room (away from elevator, close to elevator, high/low floor). I filled in the arrival time knowing that I wouldn't get a room that early but hoping they could accommodate as close to it as possible. When I checked in at 9:10 a.m. I was told my name would be put in queue to have housekeeping clean a room and they would call me. As we arrived so early I doubt there were too many names on the ""queue"". Well, it was 3:30 before we finally got a room. Why ask for our arrival time if there is no way you can honour it? Front desk staff wasn't helpful. In fact one young lady was quite rude saying well check in is 4:00.. fine, but why ask guests what time they are going to arrive??? If you're asking we assume it's because we will be accommodated as close to arrival as possible. Also, as I knew our room number at check-in I went upstairs to see if housekeeping was in the area... they were... talking and laughing in the hallway while my room needed to be cleaned... not professional sorry! People are waiting! And again, I know check in is 4:00 put DON'T ASK MY ARRIVAL TIME IF YOU AREN'T GOING TO GIVE ME A ROOM UNTIL 3:30!! As well, and I'm a dog lover, but dogs inside near the food/eating area??? No way not acceptable. One dog started jumping on people when it saw another dog and the owner couldn't control it. It was yelping and jumping while people were trying to eat. As well they were barking in the hotel room during the night. How about a floor or section of the hotel dedicated to guests with dogs so the rest of us can sleep.

We decided to get the ski package for our two night stay and it was well worth it. The safe was so friendly and helpful, and I am not sure I have ever been in a cleaner hotel room. Overall the value was very good for what got, and I think we would both definitely go back. It was my first time skiing, and I really only did the easy hills, but I thought they were long enough and lots of fun. It was a little busy during the day because of school groups, but being a first time skiing and a bit nervous of others on the hill I was still able to enjoy myself.  We also did the snow tubing, which was all you can tube for $10 a person after 4pm- so much fun! Definitely worth it. Again, the staff was really friendly and we had a great time!  The only thing I wasn't a huge fan of was the food, but then again, I may be a little picky.  Overall the trip was awesome, we will definitely be going back and I would recommend it to anyone who needs/wants a lovely winter trip- whether you are skiing or not.  As a bonus, parking it free. There is also a grocery store about 5 minutes up the road if you need anything. The location is beautiful!

Excellent burgers and good selection of beer. We ate breakfast in the main hotel. It was good but only the buffet was available and this was the only place to eat breakfast. It was ok but a bit overpriced for what you received.   We skied on the Friday and it was good and not overly busy.

The over-night had other guests being very noisy. Finally called to complain to front desk at 1 am with kids awake because of noise. Staff were responsive and actioned the noise complaint promptly. Management left a letter of apology for the noise - a nice touch - but didn't make up for being tired first thing in the morning. Breakfast buffet in lodge restaurant was average, not particularly great especially given the price of the buffet ($$$$). One concern is that the ""Kids Korral"" programme must be booked separately from the rest of the stay. First time skiing for 7 and 9 year old kids required lesson. No room in Kids Korral programme. 2 hours of dad working with kids on bunny hill followed by a private lesson for an hour (Patti was fantastic to get kids going and very helpful for me as dad, teaching me how to teach them). Lift lineups were long at times but moved fairly quickly - limited wait times. Horseshoe's hills are not particularly challenging and are very short (skiing Horseshoe is about quantity of runs, not necessarily quality). The level of challenge was perfect for beginners that progressed very quickly to Level 3 skiers (according to instructor).   Staff: Helpful in booking stay, Very helpful in checking in and dealing with noise complaint, Kids Korral staff were not particularly helpful providing incorrect information and didn't take the time to return calls looking for spots even to say there were none, Ski instructor (Patti) was fantastic, lift operators were also all very helpful. While staff were helpful, for the most part they didn't seem all that happy to be there.  Overall: Very expensive one night, one day ski day that had its rewards and its concerns.

They told me that they could not find the charge that they made in April and asked me to fax in my visa statement. I faxed it in, and after a week, they called and said they made a mistake and would credit me back the first charge (which is less than the 3rd charge by $50). I was never given an apology nor was I given an explanation for the differences in the first and 3rd charge. I had to go on their website to find out myself why there was a difference (it turns out it was due to difference prices depending on the number of people you have). If I hadn't checked my bank accounts, I would have been out $400 for no reason. Charging someone's credit card without being authorized to do so is a freaking crime!

The kids loved the slopes even though the weather wasn't the greatest and the animal show was a huge hit.

They were friendly and courteous.

We were there for a visit 2 Camp Borden to see a relative but we're very glad that we chose Horseshoe Valley Resort even for a quick overnight stay. There were not enough visitors to the resort to Merit the buffet. But the breakfast we had off of the ala carte menu was delicious and not overpriced.

But not enough to make up for the rest of my experience.   The room had no bathtub. Not a big problem but it also had no channle guide for the TV. Again not a big deal but as I don't have cable or anything it should have been a nice treat. Instead it was frustrating to get to work and find somthing to watch. (And I've worked in cable repair I know how to work a system) Worst of all the room had no temperature control. If you tryed to cool the room it shut down. And calling front desk did not help. So my nice night resulted in 0 sleep.  The restaurant crazy horse had a small menu, not a deal breaker but I do like options. What is unacceptable was that me and my wife ample time to browse the menu choose our meal and have a 15 min conversation before anyone came to take our drink order. My meal was decent and acceptable. Though my wife's fish look like it came from the frozen food section of costco.   After explaining our bad experiences to the front desk our only consolation was to not be charged the fee they add to the rooms for use of the grounds.  I'll never come back and will be happy to spread my bad experience to everyone I can to prevent someone ells having to go through my horrid weekend.",1,negative
374332100,barrie/ca/154980/185603/374332100.html,Horseshoe Resort,"I visited Horseshoe with my partner as a birthday gift to her at the end of March (27th - 29th).   The facility has elevators so that was nice. Our room was on the main floor so very easily accessible. Our room was nice with one king bed, a couch and a desk. The TV was pretty small for the size of the room and distance from the bed, but it was fine as we didn't use it much.  While we knew this was the low season, we were terribly disappointed with the offerings Horseshoe had. The pool wasn't open for very long, nor was the spa. We weren't able to go to the spa like we planned despite trying to book it very early. We had to go off the resort most of the time to town just to find stuff to do. The resort had ZERO activities for guests.  In terms of food, quite literally, nothing on the resort was open except for the Crazy Horse Sports Bar & Grill. Not even the restaurant IN the resort was open so we were forced to go to the Crazy Horse. Both times I ate there, I felt sick afterwards.   Despite all of those things, the one I'm most disappointed about is the fact that they didn't have a gift shop. One thing I do with my partner is everywhere we go, we collect magnets. We weren't able to get one at Horseshoe. I could've forgiven everything else, but not that.   Overall very disappointing experience. We will probably try again during a busier time, but not anytime soon.",1,negative
375547679,barrie/ca/154980/185603/375547679.html,Horseshoe Resort,"We are fairly pleased with our stay on Victoria Day weekend. We paid full price (no groupon or similar) and felt we got our money's worth when compared to any other stay during the holiday.  If you have a pet, this resort is superb. Dogs are welcomed and allowed everywhere in the resort except restaurants and pool. There were lots of dogs here.  Thankfully we got a room in the newly renovated building unlike some reviewers here. The room had a sunken living area and was very spacious and modern. The bathtub could easily fit two adults with space to spare.  Disclaimer: I received free passes to Slopeside Adventures through the Attractions Ontario employment program.  The grounds of the hotel and the Adventure Park (Slopeside Adventures) were well kept and very spacious. The hike through the grounds was very nice. One disappointment was Slopeside Adventures itself. I'm so happy I did not pay for this and given that I have two kids I would have been sucked into it.   The activities were very low quality and there was only enough to keep you busy for an hour if you did everything once. Only half of the activities advertised online were running and no one checked our wristbands once in two days. Everyone was doing activities without wristbands for free either because the attendant present didn't care or there was no attendant at all. If I had paid for the day pass for Slopeside Adventures I'd have been very upset.   The pools were clean, hot tub and sauna nice, arcade was great and not cheesy like some hotel arcades. The food served at restaurant Crazy Horse was absolutely disgusting and should be avoided. Bring your own groceries as there is NO GENERAL STORE on site.  All in all we paid a great price for this resort and got what we paid for. I had a good weekend and will probably be back in the future.",4,positive

Travelling on a motorcycle means I can take a limited amount of luggage- so this meant I did not take an additional pair of shoes. When dining at the steakhouse I was approached by the server and told that I needed to wear shoes (I was wearing socks) When I mentioned that I only had muddy motorcycle boots I was told that I needed to go and get them and set them next to my table. I understand the requirement of footwear (which I had) in a public place but sending me to my room to get my muddy boots while guests at nearby tables wear flip flops was ridiculous. 3) Aside from the fact that the breakfast on offer was only a buffet (really? this is a four star resort!!) I have dietary restriction that prevented me from eating some of the items being served. When I asked for some simple eggs, the response was 'I don't think so, the chef is busy with other guests, but I'll ask' I did get the eggs but was made to feel like I was causing the staff discomfort.  I was expecting a really enjoyable stay (I even joined the 'Preferred Member"" program!) but ended up being disappointed at the level of service received.",3,negative

First let me say they charge you a resort access fee, which is an absolute joke and borderline extortion. I haven't figured out what this ""access fee"" actually does, but it was almost the same as a nights stay. The only thing you don't get nailed extra for is the swimming pool...so you are paying $60 for use of the swimming pool. Otherwise anyone else off the street can walk in and pay the same money as you to do any of the activities and eat at any of the restaurants. I think it's only a matter of time before the government steps in here (like they did in the airline industry) and force hotels to advertise the actual price that will be charged. We also left a bag in the room, that was never turned in by cleaning staff... we forgot $8,000 of my wifes jewellery in Cuba once and got it back... but a couple hundred bucks of stuff in Orillia never seen again. The interior of the hotel has been updated, but the exterior needs some work. The activities are also ridiculously priced... I think it was $27 for 2 to mini-golf. The Inn restaurant wasn't the greatest either. They didn't have the proper ingredients for the first 2 drinks we ordered... and the restaurant is pretty expensive too. It is also 20min to Orillia so they are a bit out of the way.",2,negative

387154540,barrie/ca/154980/185603/387154540.html,Horseshoe Resort,"We stayed in a deluxe room with king size bed. Pretty affordable but we got a spring discount before the mad summer rates increased. The room was very nice and clean and the sunken sitting area was a very nice touch. It had a very clean and spacious bathroom with a huge tub and separate shower. I used both. Loved them. We had dinner at the Inn Steakhouse in the lobby. A very nice restaurant but I had the special maple mustard chicken and I regretted it. I took two bites and felt sick to my stomach. I should have got the steak. The breakfast buffet spread the next morning was pretty good though. The chef even asked us to let him know if we wanted our eggs a different way, to let him know. With our stay we got the slopeside adventure which included the mini putt, red horse maze, euro bungy, commando obstable, highlands climbing tower, hiking trail (which they didn't have a map or easy access to) and red horse mining cove. All these are geared towards children but we had fun with the mini putt. We couldn't do the maze because there was nobody there attending to it. The zip lining looked fun but we didn't do it. It was $20 extra. This resort had other free amenities like the pool & arcade but we also didn't use. The spa, Segway/bike tours are all extra which we didn't do them either because we had no time. I think the check in at 4pm is too late to enjoy anything there but they allow you to use the adventure pass the next day. Also, the extra $30 resort fee they charge you is unnecessary and a gouge.

The room was large, clean and best of all, quiet. Wi-fi worked well, although it kicked me off several times for no apparent reason and no warning. Lots of summer stuff - there's a climbing wall, mountain biking, an off road motorcycle training course near by that's excellent and even Segway scooter rentals.   The on-site restaurants were both very good. Breakfast was a buffet with supplemental fruit and cereals - something for everyone's taste. Had dinner one night at the steakhouse on site and it was excellent - the special was a New York strip and huge shrimp combo and it was really good and reasonably priced. For something less fancy, the Crazy Horse pub is right across the way with a good selection of local beers and decent food, although the menu is a little limited.

You could choose all healthy or go with bacon, eggs, sausage and toast, pancakes etc. They have everything if you ask. Lunch was at the Crazy Horse Tavern, again, great value and better than most for portion size, in all cases the food was close to higher end, far better than average. The room was a king deluxe with the small recessed fireplace lounge. It was perfect. Shower ran hot and actually used the huge tub after the first day of riding. Filled it up with hot hot water, it filled very quickly. Helped ward off some of the delayed muscle pain from an abusive days riding trails etc.. Slept throught he next night as well. Overall the hallway noise is minimal. The room is very clean, feels newly renovated but I am told its not. The electric fireplace would be perfect on a cold day/night.

Reasons: * Clogged sink in the washroom, the only washroom in our room. Took us 5 minutes to finish brushing our tooth, waiting for the sink to drain. * No towel service at the pool, we had to walk across the parking lot ,go to the lobby, (while we are dripping and wet and lobby is cold) and ask for the towels. The lifeguard who is sitting by the pool, could easily have a bin full of clean towels to hand out to guests but they don't bother. * There is no drink or food service by the pool. Swimming and using the pool is one of the main reasons people go to these palaces and it's absolutely thoughtless not to provide drink or food to the guests by the pool, which is a good source of revenue for the resort and comfort for the guests. * At 7:00 o'clock Saturday afternoon, Canada Day long weekend, everything in Adventure Park closed. What are we supposed to do with our kids? Of course, send them to Arcade and spend money on useless games or go to our rooms and watch TV !!!! * Even when Adventure Park is open, it's not like there is so many exciting activities going on. They don't even hire enough staff on long weekend to operate both bungee jumping for kids, there is only one open and kids have to stand in long line up to get their turns. * Breakfast buffet in summer is exactly the same as winter, no fresh fruit, they are from tin cans, sour and syrupy. No variety at the table. We won't go back to Horseshoe anymore.  Save your money and go somewhere with better customer service.

We got the call just before arriving so we had little time to change arrangements with other families we had booked with - so first of all we were split from our group - no towels to be found at either pool or front desk - no room towels or pool towels - indoor hot tub out of commission - $13 per person to play mini golf so we passed - family of 5 with taxes just under $100 - ridiculous! No coffee cups - bed linen was white - there were blood stains on the comforter and pillow case on one bed - toilet flusher handle was broken - buildings look run down - one elevator in the building took forever to get to floor 5 - room was dirty - pull out couch looked like it hadn't been changed in weeks - couches were worn and dirty - sat on my coat the whole weekend - free wifi but didn't work very well - everything costs extra so be prepared to spend money unless you just want to walk around - Tree top trekking (not part of the resort) was FANTASTIC and well worth the money - would we go back - definitely NOT

The resort is run down and showing it's age. We were down graded from another resort that had some problems and needed to switch our reservation to horseshoe valley and if it wasn't for free we would have left. Got an old room that smelled and we asked to be changed but we got no help from the staff ....we wewrn't offered another room nor were we offered any help. Both pools are showing there age and all the activities are at an added cost.....save your money and go somewhere else......they really missed an oppurtunity to wow us and get our future business.

We stayed in the slope side condo.  You will be charged an amenities fee, which is significant and won't have any amenities besides the pool. Trail hiking, biking, bungy, rock climbing, maze, mini putt are all extra. They are understaffed so your children will have to wait.  They also have children's day camp that you need to wait behind.  We wanted to do the tree top trekking but that was booked with campers. Our option was to go in a group of 37 day campers. That being said, this is a separate company.  We chose to come to do something other than Blue Mountain and we all wish we were at the Mountain.  This property has so much potential. That makes it even more disappointing.",2,negative

I thought I'd try something a little different so I booked a two bedroom slope side suite with kitchen instead of the hotel. We got to the resort and as we walked into the building it was littered with garbage in the hallway to our room. I brushed it off. Once we got into the room it was a nightmare. The smell was discussing and the room was dirty and outdated with massive wear and tear. I called reception to see if I could get an updated room....but they were all sold out! So I said I would take any other type of room in the hotel (as that's updated) and I was told it was sold out too. At this point I thought I would have to stay in this dive two night. Erg!! But then I went online and tried to book a room and there was availability..hmm!! I called reception again and low and behold we got an updated loft room. Persistence paid off this time. Once in that room things were much better.   If planning to visit I would recommended to make sure you get an updated room in the hotel unless you like to rough it or like camping. One disappointment is that the euro balls are gone. That was really fun.   Segway is a must....that would be the only reason we would go back. Or to sit by the pool and relax.

If you are prepared to stay in a room that looks like it has not been renovated since 1980 stay in the unrenovated 2 bedroom Condo.

I was pretty worried before I went there as the reviews of the hotel weren't great. The first impression of the condo building...err... it's dated and it needed a huge renovation absolutely. A group of young people was having a social gathering on the first and second floor's hallways. Fortunately, our room was on the other side of the building. The hallway's condition was pretty terrible honestly. Surprisingly the unit was better than I expected. It's big and roomy. The furniture and decor were all outdated, but still acceptable. As it cost us $200/night for a 2 bedrooms + 2 bathrooms, it's not bad! My 3-year-old son loved the enclosed balcony as it had the view of the swimming pool! He loved the outdoor swimming pool that's next to our condo. It's very convenient. My son also loved the maze and the large green space so that he could run around with daddy. It's simply a relax getaway trip for us. We drove to Blue Mountain on Saturday, but my son didn't like it there as it's packed with people. If you're looking for exciting things to do or if you want to shop, this hotel is not for you. (p/s We stayed there for 3-days-2-nights, and we didn't realize that our room didn't have house-keeping service. Anyway I brought my own towels for everyone so it's not a very big issue.

399771028,barrie/ca/154980/185603/399771028.html,Horseshoe Resort,"This resort is a solid 3 star facility. No more.  The Pros: fun activities for children, good location, easy drive  The Cons: there are many so I will categorize  1) ACTIVITIES: there are great kid activities for the under 10 y o set HOWEVER, there are not enough staff to man the activities properly. For example, on this long weekend, in a sold out facility, they were only willing to run one of two available (and working) bungey jumps. The wait was 6-8 kids. At 3 mins per kid, that is an eternity for a little one. All they needed was one more minimum-wage teenager (no doubt that's the wage- the teens that are employed here do the bare minimum). The pony ride is a a small enclosed pen approx 10m radius that the poor pony must go around and around in while the sun blisters his back. Horrid.  2) STAFF- the entire place is run by teenagers who mostly don't know the answers to anything. No matter the question, the answer is ""well, I'm not really sure...."". What kind of training do they get, if any? One of the wait staff offered us a ""red pepper potato ganache with alfredo sauce"" as the special. Ganache? One of our group finally piped up and questioned ""ganache? What is a ganache given the one I know is sweet?"" ""gnocchi?"" ""OH, YEAH! Yeah, that's what I meant, maybe I'm saying it wrong!"" Sigh. You would think the wait staff would have at least tasted the specials and been instructed in their pronunciation. We actually had to go get our own cutlery and condiments on another occasion and a wait staff said ""oh, you shouldn't have to do that!"". No, we shouldn't.  3) FOOD- do you like fries? I hope you like fries. There are fries with everything. This is a country fair/ pub food only type of place. The kids' menu doesn't have anything green on it. The ""high end"" steak place was such a disappointment. The meat overcooked, the menu uninspired. Ontario has such wonderful produce to choose from, and some of the best restaurants in the world. This resort should aspire to better than mediocre. 4) CUSTOMER SERVICE- no one answers the phone when you call front desk. Ever. 5) HOTEL ROOMS- for a place with a pool, there is no where to hang wet bathing suits. For a room that sleeps 4, you get 4 towels. That's it. Not a single one more. There are no towels poolside so you have the pleasure of marching to front desk to get towels. 6)THOUGHTFUL PROTOCOLS- for example, if you want to mini golf, you must go across the resort to get balls, and then trek back across to the mini-putt to get drivers. The pools are freezing on cold days, and too hot on warm days. There are only 2 restaurants. No options other than fries, fries, fries. Oh, and carrots and celery sticks. Whoo Hooo. I stand corrected- there is a bit of pale green on the kids' menu.   In summary, this could be a great resort. It could be. However, and this is conjecture, it is likely the owner is a cheapo who runs the place on bare minimum expenses and makes his money with one-of customers.   We would never opt to return. It's fine, but there are so many better attractions that we can spend our money on.

The golf-included one night rate was good value and we love the Valley course. The indoor pool could use a bit of re-painting and be sure to bring some snacks or your own breakfast. I was very disappointed that they don't even have a coffee bar set up somewhere anymore with some muffins, etc. We played golf early and didn't have time to drive elsewhere for breakfast, nor to get our money's worth from their buffet. Also because it was a weekday and not busy, we didn't see a beverage cart on the course until we were on the 18th hole. We were quite hungry after a 3.5 hour round. We also noticed that only one clerk was on the reception desk on Sunday a couple of hours after we arrived (still waiting for our room) with a line up of about 20 people.

We made our way to the pool which had no signage on how to enter and left us searching for access. Finally found the change rooms which were again, disgusting. Headed through to the pool entering another room which was being used to store equipment. The used towel bin was full and stacked twice as high with towels. Not a clean towel in sight as I later found out we needed to get from the main hotel pool.

The poor staff at reception were left to deal with complaint after complaint and management is off for the weekend. In my opinion: 1. Get a manager on duty at all times 2.

We are owners at Carriage Hills, a timeshare condo on top of the Horseshoe Valley ridge and gave used the Horseshoe Valley Resort facilities many times. We visited the area in late July and what I saw disturbed me. Horseshoe was once a dignified, well featured facility with quality services for a family looking for something other than an amusement park getaway week. In winter the skiing and boarding were very acceptable for Ontario (no BC or Alberta elevations here) and in the summer the golf, swimming, hiking and biking were very good.  The management team at Horseshoe have spent or perhaps wasted a lot of money on attractions. They constructed an activity centre that included a climbing wall, and a zip line (the latter is still there and pretty good). There is a Maze in the now defunct activity centre that is pretty much abandoned now and sadly to build it they removed the tennis courts. Most disturbing though is that they took a classic, Ontario woodlands golf course in the Valley course and completely destroyed the first and 10 holes. The first hole is now a 130 yard par 3 rather than the original par 4. The 10th tees were moved up by over 100 yards to accommodate a trampoline, a pond (formerly a water hazard in front of the blue tees) and a pony/donkey ride facility (now defunct). Music from the child friendly activities centre can be heard clearly form holes 10-13. The pro shop has been removed and now golfers check in at a counter along with people renting bikes and Segway rides.   Thankfully the drive off the 18th tee into the valley is as satisfying as it always been.  Horseshoe ... Not the place is one was ... and not for the better.",3,negative

Bed very comfy. Bathroom large - loved walk in shower. Large resort - our room was way at the other end from where the elevators were so long distances to walk. Also not much parking close to the hotel, so again more walking - something to keep in mind if you have mobility issues as I do. Electrical outlets in the room were weird - when charging my iPad/phone or trying to use the hair dryer the plugs would fall out of the receptacles! Wifi was good but TV reception and picture were lousy. Besides that there was no guide on the tv and no indication anywhere which channels were available. Even the most basic hotels I've been in have that. Front desk was not at all helpful when I asked who their provider was so I could find a guide on-line. Not everyone is there to do sporty, outdoor stuff so better reception and a guide of some sort would be helpful. Only one set of towels in the room so got some pool towels from the front desk but they were skimpy and looked very well-used! We got the room for a special summer rate of $99.00 which was pretty good, but then they add a ridiculous $36.00 ""resort fee"" to the cost of the room for the use of their facilities, so it ended up not being such a good deal after all.

Enjoyed all of the food items.(not free but not expensive-we prepaid). There is a very good restaurant in the Inn and the food is very good. Kind of fancy and fairly costly. If you want something less formal and reasonably prices you can dine at the Crazy Horse across the street. We dined there every night. 1/2 price apps from 3-6 each day. Daily specials like wings and a beer(Mon), burgers and fries or salad on Tues($10) and rack of ribs/slaw /pint for $24.99. A special is on now. If you play 18 holes of golf with cart you pay $49 and get a $15 food voucher-good only on the Valley Course, which is an excellent challenging course and a great deal. We had booked ahead on a golf package and they would not let us have the deal. I would come back to Horseshoe again. Great place for kids with outdoor activities(mostly for a fee) like wall climbing , zip line, mini golf, water activities, segway/biking/ hiking etc. Even an outside, inexpensive restaurant where you can get a quick burger/dog/pint/icecream etc. while taking a break from your activity.

We discovered this when we tried to open the windows when the AC didn't work. They don't by the way. 6. No bottled water. Not for free or to buy. Unforgivable. Especially sweating the way we were.  At the breakfast buffet (ho-hum) they charged an extra $3.50 for a latte. I suggest buying the machine that makes them and put it on the buffet. Factor it into the overall price if you must but many hotels are doing it these days.  We did play 9 holes of golf the following morning. Nice scenic course.  Would I return? Nope. Would I recommend? Nope.,2,negative
406167736,barrie/ca/154980/185603/406167736.html,Horseshoe Resort,"The golf courses were very good. The weather was Hot & Humid but that couldn't be helped. The location was very scenic and easy to get to from our Hamilton area residences. Nice touch was the use of a suite for our 20+ golfers to gather. Did find some issues with the hotel . On check-in, couldn't get a luggage trolley as none were available anywhere in the resort as reported by the reception. Not a big issue for us but could have been for some with physical limitations. Also the towel issue as reported by other reviewers - we too only had 2 sets and were supplied with another 2 towels apon request. Left a note for the room person each morning and got 4 sets each day - needed as with the hot weather the showers were numerous! The room we had had no information about the TV channels or hotel amenities such as emergency numbers or procedures. Frig in the room was very small and limited in what would fit so the door would close - we took to putting ice in our cooler to handle the overflow which wouldn't fit in the frig.  Brunch was good and well run - even with a large other group there during part of our stay, the brunch experience remained a good one. i",4,positive
406573175,barrie/ca/154980/185603/406573175.html,Horseshoe Resort,"The Jazz festival was awesome- better than I could have hoped for. Well organized with top performers.  The resort was very nice- room was clean and spacious. Was given a handicapped room which made the bathroom spacious. However, when showering the water would run all over the bathroom floor and into the hallway- poor design layout. This has happened a few times before as the bottom of the bathroom door was peeling.  I feel the resort is over priced.  Restaurants definitely overpriced! Servers were good-Food average.  Would recommend when booking to verify you are not over top of the wedding tent. Wedding music went on loudly until 12:00. We had inquired at the front desk earlier in the day to see what time the wedding music would wind down and were advised the wedding party would be asked around 11:00pm to turn down the volume or at least the bass. Annoying when trying to sleep.  If not for the Jazz Festival, we would have left very disappointed.
 
 
 Room Tip:  Ask to be away from the wedding tent if booking when weddings are held.

We stayed in one of the ""premier slope side condos"" that have been renovated. They're very nice but are lacking in the extras. They supply a coffee maker but for our 2 night stay only provided 1 pouch of coffee and 4 packs of sugar. Towels provided were very minimal. Wifi in the room wasn't very good. TV picture quality was poor. 2 TVs but only 1 flicker worked. Nice new stainless steel appliances in the kitchen...except the stove was still an older white electric coil type. No napkins or paper towels in the kitchen and something sticky down the front of the drawers. Couch and a chair cushion had large noticeable stains.   The condo stairwell - although you could take an elevator down, it was at the opposite end of our floor so we often chose to just use the stairs. The entire 3 days/2 nights we were there, there was dead flys all in one corner - and I mean at least 30! - and someone's spilled cheesies. Clearly no one checks or sweeps this area. Gross.   The staff tries really hard but it seems like management has cheaped out.   The food at both restaurants was really very good.   Loved the Segway tour and treetop trekking (extra $) but the activities in the Slopeside Adventures were a waste for our 13 and 16 year olds - they were either too old to do them (bungy and obstacle) or they were just lame activities for those ages.

409014692,barrie/ca/154980/185603/409014692.html,Horseshoe Resort,"We stayed in the Lodges the third week of August. The apartment was tidy but very dusty and the balcony was clearly dirty. We had to buy supplies to clean the entire place. The best in the room was the comfortable bed. Internet conneccion was extremely slow. TV image was poor.  The building has no cleaning service, same cigars or cans leaving in the sharing balcony were there from the beggining to the end of our staying. The indoor pools was ok but the outside one was full of bugs and little papers, that nobody was trying to clean anytime. The mini golf was ok, but many times we had to wait to get a golf club, there are not enough of them. Slope Adventure is kind of a joke. There are only 3 activities, a bungy jump that has 2 spots but only 1 is used, so the line is absurdely long. The obstacule course is just an inflatable game and a climbing wall that was the only one, that works well. They charge you $30 dollar for the day pass but if something is not working they charge you the same. We weren't lucky with the weather so our daughter went to Kids Korral 3 days. She had a good time and the people in charge were very nice and active. Also the restaurant Crazy Horse had awesome food and excellent service.",2,negative

From the time we checked in excited to find out what the resort offered we were shot down at the front desk about getting any help or information about the amenities. The clerk had a smile on her face but she was not going to go beyond her job of checking us in only. A map was given to us with little to no descriptions about things being offered. It was very disappointing. The outside hallways were filthy with bugs, cans, dirt and whatever was left behind from past guests. We were there 4 nights and not once where they cleaned. The condo had clean bathrooms, kitchen and beds but the rest of the condo had not been touched cleaning wise. Floors left bare feet dirty, especially in the balcony area. The worst part of all was that our stay was in a heat wave and the air conditioning in our unit was broken. Fans were set out, evidence that the resort knew about this issue,(we booked this trip back in early spring) yet they still put us in that room charging us the full rate. When it became unbearable and we did complain and were told they would remove $120 off our bill. Clearly an insult, especially when no one could even give a meaningful apology. As a family we have traveled to many resorts - Horsevalley Resort was a letdown, overpriced, and hot.",2,negative

The building was tired looking and dirty....garbage remained in the hallway for our entire stay and our unit did not look vacuumed....we picked up pieces of bacon from the kitchen floor. The worst though was a lack of air conditioning in our unit. Upon investigation, the blower motor of the unit was broken and when we complained, we were initially offered a $30.00 discount. This from over a $425.00 dollar a night stay. They finally upped it to a $300.00 discount but we were left with a bad taste on our mouths....the unit internal temperature was 79 degrees and we couldn't open the windows because there were no screens.

After sitting in the lobby for an hour and our room is still not ready and we have plans to meet friends at 6 pm. We have travel several hours to get here and it would be nice to cleanup before hand and change. I am very upset at the lack of courtesy. If they can't guarantee 4 pm then do something nice for the client. The rooms aren't the cheapest you can find and a resort of this quality should do better.

412685328,barrie/ca/154980/185603/412685328.html,Horseshoe Resort,"Don't bother going here for a family vacation unless your kids are under 10. When I asked the reservation employee if the adventure park was something teenagers would enjoy she assured me there was lots to keep them busy and specified an inflatable obstacle course and bungee trampoline. Both of these activities were clearly for small children and had signs posted all over the building stating they could only be used for those 12 and UNDER. The only activity my kids could enjoy in the 'adventure park' was the climbing wall that took them all of 2 minutes to climb. Maze was cheesy and again only took one minute to walk thru. Zip line and tree top trekking are not included, are more age appropriate and cost EXTRA of course. We arrived on a Sunday at the end of the summer and it wasn't busy. We wanted to check in early to take advantage of 'adventure park' and pool that was included in our one night stay 'package' and were told our room would not be ready till check in time of 4:00. Funny enough, the next morning two cleaning staff were on our floor at 9:00 cleaning rooms yet they couldn't have one room ready in the afternoon for us. Front desk clerk was rude and unaccomodating. She could use some lessons in customer service. Grounds were garbage strewn. Pool is very small, large pool with cabanas is not for hotel guests its only for time share/condo guests. The best part of our stay was the bartender at the crazy horse. Will never go back here. Don't waste your money!!

412714561,barrie/ca/154980/185603/412714561.html,Horseshoe Resort,"We were staying at the resort to attend a wedding held there. The day prior, we received an email asking our check-in preferences: before noon, before 4 p.m (normal check-in time) or late check-in. As the wedding was at 5 P.M. and we did not relish a 2-3 hour drive in our best outfits, we requested before 4p.m. An email came, saying this was not possible. I called the resort to ask what we could do if the room was not ready on arrival and was told we would be provided somewhere to freshen up and change.   Upon arrival at 3 p.m., our room was not ready but the shocker was where we could get ready, which was the pool area change room. My husband sat for one hour with our bags in the lobby, while I took a walk. We expected to check in at the guaranteed check-in time of 4 pm. but our room was still not cleaned. Check out time is 11a.m., so there appeared to be a real shortage of housekeeping personnel.   We then both had the joy of showering and changing in a dirty, aging common shower area connected to the resort pool. Many of the other wedding guests were in the same predicament, so the area in the ladies side was very crowded. My toiletry kit (containing shampoo etc) had to sit on the floor with water running around it while I showered, as there was no bench. There was also no place to hang my purse, so it sat insecurely unattended around the corner in the common change area. The towels were tiny.   We arrived 2 hours before the wedding to have a relaxed afternoon and lots of time to get ready and instead had a stressful and rushed experience, going back and forth to our car for items and jostling for a mirror. We got our room key at 4:50 p.m., just before the wedding started. The front desk staff made no apologies about the delay. Many other guests for the wedding were in the same boat. Some did not get rooms till 6:30pm. This was a wedding of 125 people and the rooms were booked months in advance. The hotel is under-staffed. I was never able to talk to a manager as the he or she was ""helping clean rooms"" (!) but eventually got the evening front desk staff to reimburse the resort fee.  The wedding was held in a tent at the resort and the food was very good. Once we did check in, the room was adequate, but a bar of soap instead of liquid body wash in a narrow necked bottle that was nearly impossible to pour, would have been appreciated.",2,negative
413118961,barrie/ca/154980/185603/413118961.html,Horseshoe Resort,"The Good Lots to do for Kids. Traveled with a 14, 11, and 8 year old and all were well occupied for the better part of 3 days. We paid for the adventure pass for 1 day only and that was enough for them - I don't think they would have made use of it for 3 days. Did the Zipline one day and they hung out by the pools for the other. The pools were great and clean.  We ate at the tiki hut and the Crazy Horse Grill - food was good..but a little overpriced.  Pricing of the room itself was great - I know we would have paid double to visit a place like Blue Mountain Resort.   The Bad  Although very spacious for our family of 5, we stayed in the Unrenovated Slopeside condo. They are Very Unrenovated to say the least. I don't think they have been touched in over 20 years. Although they were not dirty, the fact that they were very outdated and worn made if feel like they were not 100 percent clean.  I have stayed at older places that were at least maintained - this was not the case - closet doors not working - rust on the heaters. General upkeep would have made our stay much better.  The building itself is Very worn, cracks and rust everywhere. They really need to have better upkeep and general maintenance - one stairwell had dead insects all over the stairs and cigarette buts everywhere; elevator area had not been vacuumed for days. I had to ask the front desk to clean it up. If they had more cleaners staffed the general decay of the building would not have been noticeable.  I took a walk through the inn which was much more modern but the upkeep of the building still was lacking - stains on the carpets, chipped corners, painting needed ect.   Overall, the kids had fun and were well entertained wish was the main thing. Price was right as well. This location has much potential if some more money was invested.

AND YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR! We had a two night stay Aug 22 and 23.  From the moment we checked in every staff member we met did not seem very happy to work there. While they were not rude they certainty were not warm and welcoming and as a first time visitor, I would hope they would take more time to answer my questions instead of just handing me a map.  The room, although clean, was not really suitable. There was no soap, the light above the shower was out, and there were 2 bath towels, one hand towel, and 1 face cloth for a family for four. The fridge is tucked away but as soon as you open the cabinet the fridge fell out. It continued to be like that all weekend, falling on our toes are catching the kid’s fingers. We asked for more towels – they never came. The next day we went out and asked housekeeping for hand soap and towels and they actually told us there were out. OUT of towels in a hotel? Really? I was given a little tube of body wash to use as hand soap. We tired leaving a note asking for more towels when our room was cleaned and instead we received a note back on the door saying as we had the “do not disturb” sign out our room was skipped. So not only did we not receive additional towels they would now not clean our room. And I did not have the sign out!  I went to the front and asked if I could change rooms. I said I would pay more if we could move into the deluxe room or loft which supposedly had more amenities in the room. You have to pay more to get the even the basics in your room. I was told they were all booked and there was nothing I could do.   The hotel is also pet friendly, which I am fine with. But management needs to be sensitive of everyone! I have allergies and do do my kids and we would get into the elevator and there were chunks of dog hair on the carpet. At least designate pet free areas for people or provide free Claritin!   And you pay a $40 resort fee for “amenities”. There are no amenities and this is just a scam to up the room cost by $40 a night. This is suppose to cover coffee in the room – but they did not clean the room therefore it was not refreshed! No coffee. And there was only one package with sugar and creamer for two adults for two nights! It covers the pools - the second outdoor pool requires wristbands which we were never given and could not use the second pool. We were suppose to receive them at check in but did not. The pool towel is service is you having to walk all the way to the lobby and ask for a towel – and don’t ask for more than one, its only one per person!   Also, what is advertised on their website is not accurate. Most of the restaurants are seasonal and not open in the summer. We arrived on the Monday so we only had once choice to eat - Crazy Horse Sports Bar. It was a seat yourself restaurant which mean no one see’s you. We sat for over 30 minutes when we arrived. I asked 3 different servers for assistance and all said “I will send someone right over”. No one ever came over. I finally have to block one of the servers to get her attention and say I had had enough – only then they took our order. No manager was to be seen anywhere. When the food came is was a total disappointment. My son’s Quesada was burnt black on the outside and wet and mushy on the inside. Not fit to eat.  For the Adventure Park, the staff were useless. They just stare at you when you ask questions and are not friendly at all.   Don’t waste your time or money! You will not be treated well or get service at Horseshoe.

Scratch a little below the service and you will find that customer service and quality are not high on their list of importance. The staff is quite condescending and not very accommodating. They smile to your face but you feel like they are telling you off under their breath. The Crazy Horse sports bar is one notch at best above a cafeteria. It is a resort fairly secluded resulting in them caring a lot less about quality and customer service because they feel they do not need to. I received and e-mail asking me to complete their customer satisfaction survey. When I clicked on the link and began taking the survey a message appeared indicating they had enough respondents. To me, that says it all. How can you possibly have enough respondents when asking for your customer’s feedback? Net, net……they care just enough to make you think they care until it is too late, your trip is booked and you find out during your stay that there is no “U” in c_stomer.",2,negative

We got there around 2:30pm and the room wasn't ready so they asked us to leave the contact number so they could call us when it was ready. We didn't get any calls until 4:30pm so went over to the lobby and found out that room was ready by then. We got into the unrenovated condo and were really surprised to see the used towels left on the floor with the towel trolley. We tried to call the housekeeping, but the phone wasn't working so we decided to pick up the used towel by ourselves and put them into the trolley and push the trolley outside. It was really unpleasant experience and didn't understand why the housekeeper didn't finish his/her job. It shows lack of training or lack of management in the resort. The room was old and needs renovation, but we knew we couldn't ask for more after reviewing the tripadvisor reviews so didn't complain , but at night, the toilet flush was blocked due to lack of water pressure.......my youngest daughter cried when the washroom fan made big noise.",2,negative

Only had a couple issues; windows weren't cleaned thoroughly, they must have mistakened lotion for conditioner because when we got there we had lots of hand lotion but no condition, and the last night our phone wasn't working. They were just minor issues and when I called down to get conditioner they were sooo nice and brought some up within seconds.   We ate at Crazy Horse. It was great food. Tuesday night there is an amazing deal where two can dine for $24.99. That meal was definitely worth every penny and some. We weren't given any mints which was unusual.   They have lots of golf courses. It was my first time playing and I don't think I would recommend it was learners.They didn't direct us where to get clubs or where we even start.

415879511,barrie/ca/154980/185603/415879511.html,Horseshoe Resort,"Before going to Horseshoe Valley, our kids were very excited- I read reviews (many not positive) but thought I would judge it for myself. My experience out of 10 would be a 3.5. I was not impressed. It was not HORRIBLE, but every little thing definitely added up. It started from the beginning with the lack of knowledge from the front desk staff (they were very nice, but just seemed confused and inexperienced). Below is a list of a few problems we ran into… 1. No carts for the many bags we had. Since we were in a slope side condo, we brought groceries with us. The front desk staff advised there were carts so we wouldn’t have to make many trips up and down the elevators. There were no carts anywhere. 2. Couch was absolutely filthy! They really need to invest in a steam cleaner or get different fabric for the couches… they are just disgusting. I put down towels before we sat on them (I have photos of the couch- trust me… they were pretty bad) 3. Flies EVERYWHERE. This is probably due to the fact that the rooms do not seemed to be cleaned thoroughly prior to checking in and all of our doors were open (patio doors and screen doors) when we arrived. Also, since the rooms are not cleaned daily, garbage piles up in the little garbage can in the kitchen.  4. I don’t think bed sheets were changed on the pull out sofa- ... it was disgusting-  5. Mold on ceiling in bathroom (ensuite bathroom) - Bathrooms were so dirty. Tons of grim, some random cloth on the sinks (underneath to help a leak?) a few spots where they just forgot to paint too. 6. Our door didn’t lock ! The top dead bolt didn’t work- it did not match up, so wouldn’t lock!  7. Restaurant-My husband and I decided to go to the restaurant for a drink the first night we were there. We didn’t see a menu anywhere, so when the bartended finally noticed us (10 minutes after we sat at the bar), we asked what beers were on tap. Not a word of a lie, the server rolled her eyes, quickly named off the beers on tap then said “cant you tell, I really am not in the mood to talk to anyone tonight because my head is killing me”. I used to bartend, so I understand having a bad night- but you do not tell your guest that OR make them feel bad for asking you something. I did even say I was so sorry to ask her to name the beers off before she did. Again, I understand it can be pretty annoying. 8. Another server came over while we were having our drinks, and was pouring a beer. She was either drunk, or did not know how to pour beer. She was looking away pouring it, and it was just over flowing. Probably for a solid 30 seconds until I kind of waved my hand and pointed at the beer showing her it was over flowing. She laughed and said oops! … Just very odd. 9. So the 1st night took 10 minutes to get our bill on top of the 10 minutes it took to be served. Again, I used to bartend and waitress- we had to get to a table within minutes of the guests being seated…. Seemed to be the rule at every restaurant from Kelsey’s to fine dining. The person next to us on the first night waited longer and was super upset. He had no problem telling us how disgusted and annoyed he was with the horrible service.  10. The 2nd night we went down with the kids for dessert. It took 17 minutes to get served (for a server to notice us….) 11. Bike path’s were not set up properly like we were told they would be- The bike rental was crazy expensive. We spent over $200 on 4 bike rentals. We had them from 2PM-7PM. We thought the price would change if you didn’t have them all day.  12. The Website showed these large ball things you can go down the hills in… this “adventure” does not exist anymore. The one thing I feel we didn’t get gouged on was the Segway tours. The girls were awesome who ran it! They showed us the hill that this activity used to be one, it’s where groundhogs are now or something… I don’t understand why an attraction that no longer exists is still being advertised… The kids were very let down! We told the Segway tour guides, and they were very apologetic, which was finally nice to see. 13. Porn- hard core porn came on our tv at 9:30PM while flipping through the channels. Was not “tv porn” it was paper view type porn- after we went back to see the channel #, the station said “accessing”. We had no paper view in our room. I advised the front desk, and at first they suggested we ordered it but I told them there was no option to rent movies or anything in our room…. There was no special remotes to even click a button “by accident”. Luckily, the kids didn’t see this channel, or were sitting with us when we were flipping through the channels. 14. Pools were filthy!! Hair floating everywhere, dirt at the bottom.  15. There is no room cleaning! We should be told that there is not cleaning service while staying at the resort. I am not clear about what the resort fee is for?  16. Very unprofessional having cleaning ladies wearing yoga pants and tank tops to clean- makes it seem like they aren’t legitimate cleaners. I asked one young girl working a question, she didn’t know the answer (which was fine) but seeing her in yoga pants and an aeropostal top made me wonder if she was even a legitimate cleaner….  17. Cupboards in the kitchen were very dirty- had dried up coffee dripping down all of the one side- (stained)  18. Only 2 filters, and 1 bag of regular coffee- for our 5 day stay- if there is no room cleaning during the stay, maybe enough coffee should be provided? 19. Called room service for more sugar one night for tea- no one came up for over an hour so I called down- advised to disregard because we were going to bed- I said I would call in the morning- 7AM door knock- it was the sugar… we were all sleeping…  The one thing we did love about the trip, was the Segway tour. It was lots of fun for everyone- I think the tour guides really made it through! Becky and Teresa were awesome awesome!!!!!!! All the other interactions we had with the staff was nothing to be impressed by. I used to work in the tourist industry on Clifton Hill in Niagara Falls. Making a good impression on tourists is very very critical to the success of the company. I feel that Horseshoe Valley is trying to play in the big leagues- they talk like they are the top players, and definitely have rates like they are- but they are way way off from being in the big leagues.   I would really suggest since it’s a family “resort” they should have maybe two single beds? Or bunk beds in the front room. Doesn’t make sense to really have 2 beds only… (along with the filthy sofa bed). But having 2 rooms, and room of bunk beds might make more sense for families. I tried to keep a positive attitude the whole time we were there for the kids. But it was nothing at all to be impressed by. The survey I received didn’t ask me about my experience at all. It was a generic email. I heard a few people mention there were new owners. Why not try and make this resort amazing- top notch or like it belongs in the big leagues with Blue Mountain for example. Survey your guests on things that matter! Ask them about their experience, over all experience and their opinions. It’s the only way to help your company improve and make people want to come back and tell others about the resort! I refuse to send any of my friends or family here- for the price of the resort.  If you ever want someone to come in and assess or help improve your employees attitudes, or make suggestions about how to improve, I would be more than willing to help out. It’s a shame to see a resort that has been around for so long, start to decay.  It was not a horrible experience- we made the most of it and had fun as a family. I value my vacation time so was not going to let these things ruin it. it was just one little thing after another that made me very unimpressed.",2,negative

They are in the process of building condos here that are to be sold and ignoring items that need to be fixed first, such as - the interlocking brick walkways are heaved up, uneven and sunken below the concrete curbs causing a trip hazard, not all stairs have a handrail, the parking lot is heaved up in places and is in desperate need of being repaved. There was fairly large pieces of gravel scattered all over from the construction (I stepped on one, twisted my ankle, fell down hard and tore a hole in my dress suit pants, skinned my knee, elbow and side)  The meal we had at the wedding reception was luke warm and the chicken was dry and tasted rubbery. (The bride's parents told us the meal they had when they were sampling to choose what to have for dinner was excellant) Our table ran out of water and we asked for a refill before the dinner was to be served. They didn't bring us any and when I asked again I was told we would have to wait until after the dinner service, so we had nothing to wash down the rubbery chicken.  The room was sparsely furnished and they only give you 2 bath towels (which are about half the size of any other hotel and paper thin) 1 hand towel and 1 face cloth. There was only 1 small packet of powdered coffee whitner and 1 packet of Splenda for the in room coffee service. The room was 76F when we finally got in and even though I set the temperature for 68F after 6 hours it was still 75F. The shower door didn't close properly which caused the bathroom floor, front hallway and carpeting to become flooded. There are no hand holds in the shower or by the bathtub. (If your handicapped or elderly beware!)  The reception hall is not part of the main hotel, you have to walk quite aways outside to get to it from the main hotel. Thankfully it wasn't raining or we would have been soaking wet for the whole evening. There is no shuttle service for the elderly or handicapped to get from the hotel to the reception hall.

When I arrived aroumd 1:30 I was met by a young girl named Crystal she was very nice and accomodating....I was checked in aroung 2:15pm so I was able to get dressed in my room and not in the change room by the pool which was suggested........She helped me with my luggage and put that and my dress in a storage room so I could get a little bite to eat....I am a diabetic and I never thought to pack a light lunch for myself so you can imagine here you are in the middle of no where and one can not get a coffee or muffin or a bagel...nothing but you could go to their restaurant across the street but they served proper meals....I was able to order French Onion soup which I have to say was very good...Oh yes they do not have room service either....  The wedding was beautiful and the food was great....The whole evening was nice...  Anyway my stay turned out to be quite nice but it really had a shakey beginning....Thank heaves for your staff member Crystal who went beyond the call of duty and really looked after me....You should have people like her working in your reservation department because frankly they stink.........  I have three suggestions: Number one------ improve your reservation department Number two ---- you really should have coffee and something small like I said muffins,bagels, tea biscuit etc. as you do have a kitchen facilities to make it possible for travellers to be able to have a light snack when they arrive....after all there is not a Tim Hortons across the street from you or within miles of your site for that matter and Number 3 quests that are checking in for a wedding should not be charged resort fees on top of their room charge....I paid $205.00 for my room for me alone but I can take myself and three of my grandchildren to Great Wolf Lodge for less than that and have 4 water park passes included....

The room was spacious and clean, but was missing half the lightbulbs, had a fridge that made enough noise for us to unplug and was lacking in basic amenities (only two tiny towels, no hand soap). In the hallway we were in, every so often a loud vibrating noise would fill the room, never did figure out what it was, but it happened at all hours. Hotel prices were good, but the resort fee ($26+tx person) seemed to be a bit of a scam (at least during summer/fall season). Desk staff said it didn't include mini-put, chair-lift or mountain biking. Not sure what it did include. There is no room-service, or even a brochure in the room to give guests any information. Crazy-Horse, the bar-restaurant on the resort was horrible. The service was slow, despite being empty and the food was worse. Keep in mind there are only two other food options, the Steak house in the Inn, and Loogie's down the street.  Would go the area again, but would stay somewhere else.

428259519,barrie/ca/154980/185603/428259519.html,Horseshoe Resort,"I recently attended here for a conference for two days. I checked their web site well in advance, and was excited by all the activities they had available at the resort. Our drive there was beautiful - fall colours were out in full force. When we exited the highway, we expected to see signs directing us which way to turn, but there were none. Of course we went the wrong way, asked directions, and turned around. For a resort of this size, I was surprised there wasn't more signage to direct you to the resort; particularly when exiting the highway.  On arrival, signage was again lacking - lots of buildings, but little to tell you exactly where to check in. The inn itself was beautifully decorated and the rooms were very clean with large bathrooms. I had a slight problem with the temperature control in my room (as did many others), but after calling the front desk, maintenance was there within five minutes and corrected the problem. One thing that was glaringly missing from the rooms was a directory. There was nothing to tell you the layout of the resort or where the services were located. When inquiring at the front desk, I was given a very basic small folded handout (the map with corresponding legend on the back was so small it was barely readable).   One thing I had hoped to do while there, was zip lining. Unfortuntely, that, as well as many other 'summer' activities were finished on Thanksgiving weekend....missed it by two days! So despite the 70 degree temps, I was disappointed not to be able to try it.  The Crazy Horse restaurant is directly across the road from the inn. Food was pub style and service was good.   Signage, or the lack thereof, was again an issue when trying to find our conference room. Although the front desk employee said it was across the road, it was confusing as the building across the road was the Crazy Horse restaurant. Only after wandering, were we able to determine that snaking through a hallway beside the restaurant led to the conference room.   Despite the signage issues, and my disappointment at not being able to participate in some of the activities there, it really is a gorgeous location and a beautiful resort. After checking the web site, make sure you find out what's available before you go.

The food at both restaurants we ate at was wonderful :-) I do have a couple of suggestions for the staff of the Inn though.  1. When booking people with dogs, put them at the end of the hall, furthest away from the front desk. (in a strange place dogs can be on edge for a few hours and with every person that walks by the room it brings forth a small grumble or bark) We were in room 113 but if we had been at the far end of that hall it would have been much easier.  2. There is no waste container outside by the front door where we had to go out with the dogs, We always stoop and scoop and it would be nice to have somewhere to put it rather than in the lobby waste bin at the front door. We would have loved to go out the back doors, but there is no way to get back in unless you prop the door open and that defeats the purpose of a security door (maybe an intercom or card reader would help with that?)  We really enjoyed our stay, the fall colours were amazing and we loved the walking trails. We will definitely be back and would like to try the Tree Top Treking for sure!

The first night we got there, we decided to go to the Crazy Horse across the parking lot. Terrible service to say the least. It's seat yourself... so in other words, no one serves you. It was fairly busy but the table next to us (a family of 5) were paying and when the waitress came over, we made eye contact but she never said anything. Then, 2 other waitresses saw us as well and never came over to give us water, or to even say that she'll be right with us. We were waiting for 20 minutes... THEN, another couple went and sat down and they were served. We were so pissed that we left. As the only asian couple in the restaurant, we (for the first time ever) actually felt discriminated against. The next day, we ask the front desk about the activities that we could do on the resort and they told us to go to Guest Services. Good luck finding it... once we did, we asked the person working there what there was to do and she literally said ""there's nothing to do.""

There was also a reptile display where parents took pictures of the kids holding and touching various snakes -- poor snakes were covered with stick cotton candy! The new adventure park resort was under renovations - sidewalks were being laid, dirt roads not paved and buildings under construction when we visited. I saw a little kid get hurt when his shoe get stuck in-between a unfinished pathway.  We paid in advance for the Adventure Park to try out the longest zip line in Ontario, zorbing, skateboard and mountain bike parks, a climbing wall and more. - the zip line was closed - the dry (harness) zorbing wasn't available - there were long line-ups (min. 45 minute wait) for summer tubing and zorbing - the zorb lift was not operational (trucks were going uphill with zorbs - increasing wait times) - they ran out of oil to put on the bottom of the tubes, so they sprayed water instead - the tube ride was lame (slow and didn't go the distance) - we were not advised that we had to bring our own mountain bikes, so we missed out on the mountain bike parks ...out of the 12 activities listed in our Adventure Park pkg., we experience less than 1/2 and did not get properly compensated. Besides our family, we heard others complaints about the resort and disappoints in the Adventure Park. Staff showed their own frustration with how everything wasn't organized and were not sympathetic to customers and didn't know how to handle complains. Management was scarce and didn't address the situation. At check-in I spent 1-1/2 at the front desk trying to get answers. We were given the cell phone number of the GM to try to get answers and were charged for the room call. After 4 times at the desk and phone calls to the GM, I was directed to the Activity Centre when we checked-out and was given 1 free zip line voucher for my family to use at another visit.  Our room (3rd floor, furthest away from the elevators) was filthy: cracks and marks on ceilings and walls, dirty glasses, rug not vacuumed, smudge marks on doors, windows and mirrors and there wasn't a screen in the windows (a child could easily fall out of the 3rd storey window)-- many safety issues all over the resort! Food was over-priced, unhealthy selection and not good. For lunch we ate at a outside BBQ -- the BBQ wasn't working very good, our burgers were undercooked, the condiments were in the sun all day with flies all over them (the mayo was going bad, the lettuce was dried-up). Our family are frequent travelers and have been to many Ont. Resorts (Delwanna Inn, Delta Grandview, etc...) and this by far is the worst. We should have saved our money, the gas and gone somewhere else.",1,negative
71275616,barrie/ca/154980/185603/71275616.html,Horseshoe Resort,"Booked a couple nights with my kids to go to the adventure park and stay in the hotel.When i read the website it said something were not up and running so on friday i called the front desk as we were coming in sunday. I was told things would be up and running monday, so everything was cool. We check in sunday..come monday morning nothing was up and running except the rock climbing wall. The whole adventure park is full of construction vehicles so there is NO WAY this park was going to be up and running. I was told summer tubing was running but after going there twice with my kids at different times, noone was on the hill to run it. The purpose of my trip was the adventure park, so we wasted 2 nights staying in a hotel for no reason. Very disapointed that the staff would tell us everything was going to be fine and come up on sunday when no way it was. We could have saved our money and rebooked when it was functional. I understand things get delayed but to mislead guests to come and stay in the hotel was wrong. I have emailed last week with no reply yet to management. I talked to front desk staff but there was nothing they could do.  I am a repeat customer and I am very disappointed in this resort as of right now. brutal",1,negative

We were pleasantly surprised. We were on third floor with a newly renovated room. The bathroom was updated and modern. The feather bed/duvet on the bed was very comfortable. The room was very clean. All the staff were cheery and helpful, including those that we encountered on the grounds. I also found the fitness facility had a good selection of equipment and was very comparable to a more expensive hotel. We thought the buffet breakfast was reasonably priced and more than met our expectations.  Our only disappointment was the delayed opening of the Adventure Park but felt that Horseshoe Resort handled our disappointment in a more than satisfactory manner.

72248433,barrie/ca/154980/185603/72248433.html,Horseshoe Resort,"We just returned from this 'motel' yesterday and we couldn't have been happier to leave.   I booked through travelzoo for the wifes birthday. It 'seemed' like a great deal so I jumped on it and I should have done my research like I normally do.  To give you an idea of how picky we are, we find general hotel chains like the marriott, holiday inn and best westerns fine and have enjoyed our stay in them. We have fun generally wherever we go.  The room we were given at the horseshoe was extremely dated and in bad need of reno; paint was peeling, 60's decor (colours, carpet, paint, furniture). Most tv channels were fuzzy, half the light bulbs were burnt out, white drapes were very yellow (again most likely from the 60's. Bathrooms had no fan and bad ventilation, don't take your date here, we could actually smell a bathroom in another room walking down the hallway, twice. The beds were the only thing 'new'. I called the front desk and let them know we were on a special occasion and were not happy with the room, first I asked if there were 'reno'd' rooms. They told me there are but only a couple with double beds in them and they were booked. They were nice enough to give us a fridge for free for the night, this is not included in any of the rooms you have to pay $25 plus an ""amenity fee"" (more on this after) each night for a fridge!  The only beverage vending machine in the Inn and surrounding area does not work, be sure to bring your own water etc. especially if you have kids or you will have to drive up to 20 kms away in the middle of the night for a drink.  The rooms are not cleaned well, I looked beside our night table and saw a large package of prescription pills, well they were not ours and if I had children with us I would have been pretty angry to say the least. When looking around furniture, under and beside you can easily see that they only clean the open areas.  As far as food goes we find kelseys, crabby joes etc to be good, again we are pretty easy going.  The food at the 'inn', we had breakfast, is mediocre at best. We had dinner at Crazyhorse, worst steak my wife has ever had, it looked awful I wish I had the time to take and post pics of this stuff. The Crazyhorse and Inn are the only places to eat here within roughly 20kms so bear in mind. There is a higher priced dining area in the horseshoe which we didnt try, given what the rest was like up to this point I figured the meals couldnt possibly live up to the cost.  Now for the ""Amenity Fee"" - this is a 3% tax put on EVERYTHING including the Crazyhorse restaurant. There is also HST taxed on top of this resort fee/tax. Now when we booked this entire package it was about a 30% discount which is why I took it but by the time I finished paying all the resort tax plus hst tax it was more of a 15% discount. The worst part is I asked if there were such fees when booking, they said ""no"" and I got my cost breakdown over the phone and paid everything two months in advance of our trip. When we checked out there they rebilled everything and added the tax on! Very sneaky and horrible business practice. I asked then if it could be waived they said no however I have since spoken to people who have had it waived.  I normally use this site to do my research and I have never had the time to write reviews but I had to go out of my way to make sure people don't go through what we did here. Beware of so called ""deals"" to this place and the hidden fees/costs. Please do your research as there are much better places like this for the money, try blue mountain collingwood maybe, not sure about fees/tax might want to check it out but I know I would much rather go there especially with kids.  I would never go back to this place.",1,negative
72275557,barrie/ca/154980/185603/72275557.html,Horseshoe Resort,"The resort is undergoing some major refurbishment to attract summer visitors. Not all the attractions are open but it does look pretty impressive and will be great when finished. As we were travelling without children the fact all the activities were not open was not important. If you did have children I am sure they would have been disapponited not to be able to have a go on the giant zip line.   The hotel room was spacious and very clean, a little dated but very good. The resort is isolated so you would need a car. We used the hotel as a base, driving around 100km per day to visit the areas we had planned on.  The restuarnt on site was excellent with an extensive menu. The set menu price was $30 CAD great value for money. Wine was expensive but this seems consistant with all the hotels in Canada. The Crazy horse bar/diner, was excellent value for money with a wide variety of food to keep adults and children happy. The portion sizes were huge, more food than one person could eat.  I would recommend this resort without reservation, in the future I think it will be VERY popular with families due to the activity area being developed.",4,positive

I'll admit that I didn't read any of the reviews prior to booking, but once I started reading some of them I was a little apprehensive until we finally arrived. I would say that my comments are on par with some of the recent ones. Both my wife and I really enjoyed our stay at the Horseshoe resort.   While our room was indeed a bit dated in terms of decor, it was clean and comfortable. The bed was good for my back, the temperature controls worked and there was plenty of space. Even the whirlpool in our king size suite was working! We went for a walk on one of the many nearby trails and it the weather and conditions were just perfect. We could see that there was still construction happening on the Adventure Park but it seems that all attractions are operational. The staff was very friendly throughout the resort.  We had breakfast both mornings at the Crazy Horse. By booking breakfast through the hotel directly we saved a few dollars, so we were quite satified with a full hot breakfast for only $10 each. We ate one night at the Silks fine dining restaurant and were also pleasantly surprised. We felt that the fixed price menu was good value for the $30 we paid each.  We also had the opportunity to have massages at the Shizen Spa. The massage therapists were very good and the surroundings were comfortable. We even had time to take a quick dip in the hot tub.  All in all, we were very satisfied with our visit and would gladly come again with our family and friends once again. We managed to get an excellent supersaver rate directly from their website, so we hope to be able to take advantage of a similar deal in the future.",4,positive

I should have checked out this website before we hit the road since turn out everything one of the reviewed said was true, this place is a piece of crap... We left Toronto and drove 1.5 hours to get to the park and upon arriving, this girl at the front desk told us that 2 out of the 6 activities in the all day pass was not working!!! We thought since we drove all the way here we don't want to go back empty handed, so we asked for a discount, guess what? She said that since the group rate (there are 17 of us) is already discounted, they can't offer the 20% off discount that they offered to everybody else! What the heck, how is it fair, we gather together to go for the group rate and that's the regular price for group rate, it's not a freaking discount... after 10 minutes of talking back and forth and twice in between, the manager came out and asked us to gether aside so we don't block the way of the other customers while there wasn't even any other customer, it was all my friends lined up there.... anyways, after 10 minutes talking back and forth, they won't offer us any discount, won't offer anything, they don't seem to be interested in getting our business..... we were all so pissed, we decided to drive over to Wasaga beach for the day.

78166698,barrie/ca/154980/185603/78166698.html,Horseshoe Resort,"I am not one to be too concerned about a broken tile in the bathroom or spiders in the shower, however, I do have concerns when this resort failed to deliver on the package I purchased. For my husband’s birthday I had purchased a gift card from Shoppers Drug Mart (Life Experiences). The gift card was for a one-night “Romantic Get-Away for Two at the Horseshoe Valley Resort”. The package cost $300 for which I was promised a night for two in a parlour suite, bottle of wine in the room, and the piece de resistance - gourmet dinner for two and breakfast in the Silks restaurant. When I called the resort to book my “romantic get-away” I received confirmation through e-mail that my romantic dinner was booked for 7:00 p.m. in Silks on the Sunday night. However, upon checking into the resort I was informed that the Silks restaurant and lounge were only open Tuesday – Saturday and as this was Sunday evening - was offered instead coupons for the Crazy Horse Saloon. I was also informed that I was the fourth Life Experience customer that evening who had received this “disappointing” message. At that point I would have accepted an upgraded room or gift certificate to the on-site spa to compensate me for this failure to provide what I had purchased. Unfortunately a simple “I’m sorry” was all I was given – not a good customer recovery strategy!!! Dinner at the Crazy Horse was pleasant enough – as they advertise - it had a “fun-filled atmosphere, friendly service and casual food.” But this was not the “romantic gourmet experience, in an elegant dining room” I had anticipated nor indeed purchased. Upon returning home, I e-mailed the resort directly to let them know of my experience and was assured that the manager would contact me directly regarding my complaint. I also contacted Shoppers Life Experiences and informed them that the product they are advertising is not provided. I was assured by both the Horse Shoe Resort and Shoppers that I would be compensated for my less than satisfactory Life Experience. Call me impatient but…. It has been six weeks and despite a number of messages to the resort I have never received any communication from the manager nor indeed an apology or any gesture to compensate me for this less than satisfactory experience. Apart from the four “disappointed” Life Experience customers that evening, I also met a young couple who had purchased an adventure package, and they too were informed that the activity they had purchased was “closed for repair”. So in one evening this resort was aware that they had “disappointed” five couples!!!! I had read all the “disappointing” and “scam” reviews of the resort on Trip Advisor, but just assumed everyone was being a little picky or exaggerating – not so. Therefore I strongly advise my fellow Trip Advisor friends to read all the reviews on this resort before you book and unless you want to be “disappointed” I recommend you look elsewhere for your “base camp for adventure.” Horseshoe doesn’t deliver!!!",1,negative

The trails are challenging and you can tell that they were built by riders, lots of drops, berms and jumps....I hope they spend more money on these trails. Keep the Bike Park, the Skate Park, Climbing Wall and get rid of everything else. Don't spend your money, go to Wonderland, closer to Toronto, almost the same price.

The resort had everything I needed. I stayed at the lodge. The 2 bedroom suite was situated across from the Inn. I was at the top floor, and at first I wasn't too keen on having to treck all my supplies/belongings up to the 5 floor. Yes they had an elevator, :) The view at the top, overlooking the ski hills, was breathtaking. the fall colors were spectacular. I was glad to bring my paint supplies, and do alittle painting of the landscapes. I am so glad I did. The suite had an enclosed, glass balcony. It was PERFECT. I set up my art supplies, and had my perfect studio, right there on the balcony overlooking the hills. I loved the tranquility of the place. It was like home, away from home. The only negative, were the stains on the carpet, and the fact that the lodge itself, is alittle dated. The adventure park, is so cool. A great family vacation destiny.

I was informed daily that events and activities we had been promised and had planned carefully were not available (i.e. I wasn't told that the Adventure Park was only open Saturday and Sunday). They changed our golf tee times twice. The Inn receptionist had no idea how we were and kept telling people who arrived that there was no such conference being held at the resort! And, worst of all, a week before, informed us that AV equipment would cost $2000, which is completely ridiculous.  The rooms were clean, tidy, but old and in need of updating. The pillows were so big and hard that I couldn't use them, and was woken up constantly throughout the night by the very old, very loud vents in the room. Food was good.

Sleeping with the kids wasn't fun as we all kept rolling to the middle. The pool was pretty creepy with the green water.

The hotel was packed for the night because of the festival in Orillia. In the morning they served a nice breakfast, just a little something to get you going. There was fruit, hard boiled eggs, a selection of cereals. juice, coffee exc. all included with the price of the room. Getting in and out of the location can be a challenge as the intersection of the location is quite busy. So I would advise to wait til after a rush hour. The staff was very friendly and I wouldn't hesitate to stay there again. The hot tub was a perfect temperature and the pool was great as well. When we got back from the concert at Casino Rama we had a very hard time finding a parking spot because the hotel was sold out and had to park in a reserved spot, but when we told the girl at the desk we did this she said that was fine and to go ahead and park there. Glad our vehicle was still there in the morning.",4,positive

The service is excellent and the rooms are always very clean.   Unfortunately this time there was a baseball team of young kids staying across the hall from us that were very loud till about 12:30 am. Kids were running up and down the hallway making lots of noise. Then again at 2:30 am for about 15 minutes. Some of the dads were drinking beer out in the hall till 12:30 am. Some people have no respect for others.  Thank God for earplugs. I just feel sorry for the other guests who had a hard time getting any sleep.  This one incidence would not keep us from coming back. I just don't think people should be allowed to drink alcohol in the hallways at any time let alone well past 11pm.,5,positive

The rooms aren't bad, the bathroom fan was pretty loud and when you walked to the pool, they should have signs or you might get lost, also in every area there is a different micro-climate. *No elevators!* The pool looked ok and the hot tub, although a little dirty was warm enough. Breakfast was ok but get there early or they run out of eggs and your out of luck. They will charge you $2 for having a safe in the room? The first time we stayed, they made dinner reservations for us at the Keg and we got a discount off dinner, the second time no discount and the Keg denied having any deal with the Travelodge, only with the Best Western. Also, they will charge your credit card for potential incidentals to the room, which really makes me mad, that's like charging people for potentially smoking in a non-smoking room! Really?!

The room was extremely spacious and had all the amenities we needed. (We have stayed in a number of other hotels, all over Ontario, the Caribbean etc, and some of our rooms have been so small!)

137026196,barrie/ca/154980/186877/137305077.html,Travelodge Barrie On Bayfield,"Stayed with my wife at this hotel at 300 Bayfield St for one night only - August 11/12 as we were in Barrie for a wedding. The block of rooms had been negotiated by the brides parents for out of town guests.  There was no doubt that the hotel is rather dated - from the front lobby, the continental breakfast area, the hallways and certainly the rooms. Besides the decor being dated, the pillows on each of the two beds (double size, not queen) were of different consistency and it was our impression that they were the same pillow, but that two were rather old and simply not as firm as the other two. The shower is the older style one piece molded and the fixtures were rather pitted with age. The air conditioning unit was noisy to say the least as it was more than evident when it kicked in and the loud noise when it shut off from it's cooling cycle. We had arrived one hour prior to the wedding and had not turned the a/c on and only noticed the noise when we returned to the room and did turn it on about 1:30 am on August 12 - a little late to have the staff do anything about it then. We also noticed that the wall mounted a/c unit blew the cool air directly up in between the window curtains and the window rather than into the room, so we had to adjust the curtains to allow the air to flow into the room.   We did not make use of the pool and hot tub which are open from 9am until 10pm daily. We were on the first floor and the odour of chlorine was quite evident in the hallways even though we were a distance from the pool itself.  The hotel does have an ATM machine for guests and a continental breakfast from 6 am to 10 am.   It is very conveniently located immediately on the west side of the exit off of the 400 highway at the Bayfield exit. .   The staff at the front desk were very polite and courteous.",2,negative

This would not have even been on my list of options! I tried to go in with an open mind for my daughter's sake and so she would have a great time with her team. My mind was completely open, until about 15 minutes before we left to house to go to the hotel. I wanted to check to see if they have mini fridges in each of the rooms (which they do) and so I googled the hotel. To my horror, I found there was a very horrendous and unfortunate event which happened at the hotel in May 2012.   We still went (against my better judgement). The hotel was really bad. The staff were friendly and helpful, but didn't dress professionally. They wore their uniform shirts untucked and unironed.  The first room we were put in was extremely dated. The sheets were clean and that's about all I can say about it. The bedspreads were old,as were the curtains. Our bathroom shower did not work. They were very good about switching our room to one where the shower did work, but the new room was not much better. There was some mold in the bathrooms and they were not great at all. The hairdryer only worked when half plugged in! When I pulled down the bedspread, there were cigarette burns in it. Our bed was not horrible, but others in the groups said their mattresses sagged terribly in the middle. The blackout blinds were shredded on the inside, thus defeating the blackout purpose. The carpet was very dark and to be honest, I didn't want to look too close.  The breakfast area was very small and the food did not look appealing at all. Both days we went elsewhere for breakfast, which added to the price we had to stay at the place. Luckily, there were a lot of restaurants around.  The indoor pool was gross. It actually smelled very strongly of chlorine and many of those who swam complained their eyes burned terribly even hours after getting out of the pool. The pool water actually changed the white on my daughter's suit to yellow. The pool towels are not at the pool, but rather the front desk, which is a hassle if you don't know that before you get into the pool. The pool is in the basement and the front desk is on the second floor.  I will not be staying at this hotel again. Both nights the police arrived to kick out ""rowdies"". The hotel also had a security guard on the premises, which did not make me feel safe at all, especially after what I had read. Had I known before, I would not have booked the hotel with the group. It wasn't very nice and expensive for what we got. Extremely disappointed!",1,negative

The rooms were very average, clean and comfortable, but with small, older bathroom and noisy old air conditioner. Our son enjoyed the pool, but there were no pool towels. We found out later that you were supposed to pick your towels up at the front desk and bring them with you. That didn't help much when we were dripping wet!  Unfortunately, we had a group of partiers on our floor (not from our soccer team). They were loud and drunk, but by midnight, they seemed to quiet down. Unfortunately, they had gone out and gotten even drunker, and then one couple proceeded to have a huge LOUD domestic dispute right in the hall. He was banging on the door, she was screaming, etc. etc.. This went on for a very long time. Several of us called security, who apparently came up there, but could not resolve the situation. I think the police were called, but I am not sure what they did, because the fight did not end. Needless to say, we all had a terrible night and we all complained to the desk in the morning. They said our complaints would be reviewed by the manager.  About a week or so later, we received a voucher in the mail for a free nights stay at their hotel, valid for 11 months. I called them up to tell them that their voucher was useless for us, as we would not be back in Barrie. I asked for a full refund on my credit card or a voucher for a nights stay at any other travelodge. Anyway, the manager was very accomodating and we were able to work it out. We will be staying at another travelodge in another city at a later date.

Happily there were no hockey tournaments going on and it was fairly quiet. On the plus side, it has a nice indoor pool and large hot tub that is above average temperature, with two very strong jets for deep relaxaaaation. And a small change room. There was a complimentary bath robe, (just one but were given a second after pleading our case, how many guests are alone?) We booked a king bed and the four king rooms are all on top floor, no elevator. The bed was excellent, room clean enough. A nice sized t.v. with many channels. The pool area is 3 levels down, so for a couple seniors, it was a bit of a hassle. But that's the way it is and can not really complain about that. On the down side, the pool and spa water was not clear; it was clean but not sparkling as I keep my own pool. Breakfast area very small and not a great selection. Some money should be spent on fabric softener for the laundry staff as towels and robes were very coarse and not at all pleasant. But for the price, and location, it was just what I was looking for, not disappointed at all. It is not grand, but they do not charge grand hotel prices. No surprises here. Try it, but avoid potential hockey tournament periods.

I was surprised to see that the room came equipped with a microwave and a flat screen TV as the furniture and décor was obviously not updated recently. There was lukewarm water to take a shower that night even when I turned it to the hottest temperature. Everything smelled musty and damp.,2,negative

We asked for a different room and were told no. The lady in front of us cancelled her room because they didn't need it and the front desk girl was ignorant and said that they could not give the room to us because it was booked online. Both ladies, the blonde and red head were ignorant and should not work in customer service that is for sure. The room was disgusting and the smell was horrible. Never again, we wrote to management and did not even receive a response. Great customer service would usually include an apology at the least! Very disappointed. We ended up cancelling our room and driving back home.

A dog owner dropped some sort of powder in the corridor on Saturday and it was still there 3 days later on Tuesday! The whole place reeks of cigarette, even in the non-smoking areas.

Told her we had two small dogs at which point in time, she proceeded to give me treat bags for each. They loved their treats! The lobby is clean and has great character, we proceeded to our room and despite some of the reviews, we enjoyed it, love the brick accent wall. Beds were comfy and room was noticeably clean. I'm very fussy with that. The only thing I might do is upgrade to nice comforter/duvet sets with lots of pillows to make the bed more inviting, as that was plain.

Old furnishings, dated decor and mattresses which are about 5 inches thick and about 40 years old. The entire place looks in desperate need of an overhaul. Strongly recommend you closely inspect the bedding and beds if you find yourself here. Very sketchy. Given a smoking room(who still has these?) and the entire wing and room just reeked.  Strange check in procedure where you are charged extra for rent of a safe you have no intention of using - and which in most places that do have a safe - provide for free. Not that anyone that would be staying in this place would require use of a safe but thats another story. Should have known this was bad news when I googled it and there was an article about a double murder back in 2012.  For this type of place they should should be charging 70-80 dollars not the 124 they were gouging us for. And thats the rub. No problem with places like this operating but when you charge higher rates than the customer expects a certain level and standards - not a border line flop house. If I am worried only about money and I make a decision to stay at a cheap place than I can live with all the negatives but don't charge what a decent place charges and expect people to be satisfied with this rubbish.

During the week, the included breakfast is only served until 9am - on weekends until 10.? why not make it consistently 10 ? We show up at 9:15 on a Friday & its being taken away - again, disappointing. The front desk charges you a $2 'user fee' for the safe in your room, unless you ask to have it removed it is tacked onto your bill with the only notice given in print taped to the front desk. Hope they like that little bonus, that most people probably wouldn't notice - how cheap!  They also still have a 'smoking' room choice. We had to walk the hall here to get to the pool & the smell was disgusting. Is a smoking room still an option in Ontario? Would stay at an alternative property, even with a caa discount...not worth the money.

It was a quiet non-holiday weekend on a chilly rainy day which probably explained why it was so mellow, but I would definitely stay here again.

To be honest, i was a little worried with reading some of the reviews but i prefer to find out on my own. I arrived early and was able to check in. Being a non smoker i asked for a non smoking room. The first one i was given had a very strong smoke smell to it and seeing as the hotel charges a security deposit i didn't want to be on the hook for someone elses bad habit. Once i talked to the girl at the front desk, she gave me a second room which turned out to be fine. Clean and fresh smelling. Now, this is an older hotel so i wouldn't expect all the funrishings to be in immaculate condition and i was pleasantly suprised. Yes, it could use some updating but the room was clean and well kept. I didn't encounter any noise other than some idiot having a freak out over how his young children were acting at the pool deck. It was obvious where the behaviour came from (monkey see, monkey do). My only issue was with the parking. The event i was attending ran late, so when i arrived back at the hotel at 1:30am finding a parking spot was almost impossible. One coach bus was taking up 8 spots, many (14) CP Rail work trucks took up 2 spost each and some of the bigger ones took up 5. I was told imay have to park in the canadian tire parking lot across the road (no). All in all, not a bad experience. I understand it's a touristy town this time of year, but the rates charged are a little high for what you get. Charging the security deposit somewhat baffles me, but to each their own.

229779767,barrie/ca/154980/186877/229779767.html,Travelodge Barrie On Bayfield,"We stayed at this hotel in lieu of our normal choice in Barrie, after it being recommended to us. The hotel is conveniently located off the 400 and it stands out once you leave the ramp and get to the traffic lights. The hotel exterior looks nice and there is ample parking. Walking in, you are greeted by a large cathedral lobby, complete with a large fireplace. Check in was slow at the time because ""Kim"" was alone and there were about 4 groups that came at the same time. Despite this, Kim was friendly to us. Our room appeared clean when we walked in, The beds were comfy and linens fresh. The bathroom was a different story. Although the sink looked okay, the overall appearance was not great. The floor edges were excessively dirty from mopping the main surface area. The tile work and caulking was not professional. The shower taps were not sparkling and in fact were dull from what appeared to be soap residue. The center shower knob trim was falling off and quite annoying when we used it. The temperature of the water during a shower swinged constantly. If the bathroom was any indication of the general maintenance of this hotel, then there would be some concern from guests. Breakfast the next morning was good. There were hard-boiled eggs, toast, bagels, juices, coffee, fruit etc. There are no fresh waffle machines that are found in other similar hotels (not a big deal, just a wish). We didn't have time to use the pool but the fact that they had one would be an asset for families staying there.  Overall, the hotel is conveniently located off the main highway, close to some key businesses, and has a pool. Management should take a ""once-over"" look at their room bathrooms and clean up the edges of the grime that may be on the floors. Ensure the shower chrome is like a mirror when cleaned so guests don't think that someone just used their shower before they got there. We would stay here again in the future, as a second choice.

Things started off badly, and got worse by the minute. We were unable to check-in early despite having requested to do so when we booked. Front desk staff struggled with our team's check-in, and what should have been a simple process with 6 rooms secured on one credit card, with rooms to be paid individually upon checkout became a paperwork nightmare that staff could not process. No elevator. Lobby was deceptively ""ok"" looking. Hallways smelled like smoke, and rooms smelled musty and smoky. Beds were so low to the ground that the wrinkled bed-skirts were pooled in puddles around the beds. No duvets - just cheap broadcloth-like sewn coverlets on top of wrinkled blankets. Sheets were inside out, and too small for the beds. Chairs in room were upholstered to sit at small round table - but were covered in what could only be described as ""bodily-fluid"" looking smears and stains. Put these out of our room straight away. Description of ""deluxe"" free continental breakfast was a joke. No fresh fruit - no sweetener, flimsy paper plates, and a very limited selection of bagels. Asked the front desk if they had any glass wine goblets, and they loaned us two, but one of them still had a lipstick ring on it!! Sat in lobby that evening to visit, and observed questionable comings and goings, rowdy party goers, and food delivery men that did not check with the front desk before wandering into the hotel room hallways. Taxi after taxi pulled up in front. Non-existent security, (front desk staff were often outside smoking while guests were arriving to check in, etc. ), shabby furnishings, and unkempt facilities.

I was not told this when booking online, I asked if we could be switched to another room but the staff was unwilling to help us out. The hallway smelt like vomit, and the room smelt like an ash tray. What appalled me the most, was that when getting into bed we found cigarette butts and food crumbs. The sheets clearly had not been replaced after the previous guest. We opened the window to try airing out the smell of cigarettes, but the window had no screen and we were worried about critters getting into the room while we were out. Not only is the hotel in awful condition, but it seems to be a hot spot for people who are in Barrie to party (I'm not too sure why). We got back to the hotel at about 2am, to find a large group of young adults half dressed and being questioned by security, and they continued to party until 8am.

The staff were attentive in the breakfast area and front desk, they cant control the decor or the fact there is no elevator. The pool was great but had too much chemical and the teams eyes were burning red after 15 mins of swimming. The sheets on the bed were very thin, bought blankets at Canadian Tire to sleep on. There was a security guard on duty, was grabbed and abducted by the younger people in the room down the hall and emerged 15 mins later, strange occurrence but kind of funny.

We have a close friend, who lives in Barrie, who has been diagnosed with terminal cancer. She is 78 and over the past year has lost her sister, her 43 year old daughter, and her sister-in-law, leaving her and her 54 year old son as the only remaining members of the family. Our friend was transferred to Hospice of Simcoe on the day before Christmas  We planned to be with the two of them for Christmas day, so that they would not be alone. We called to book a stay at your hotel for Christmas night, before returning to Midland the next day.   When we called for reservations, we requested an early check-in time for noon of Christmas day, to allow as much time with our friends as possible. We were told that they would do their best to accommodate us.  We arrived at 12:20 Christmas day, and were met at the check-in counter with a staff member that did very little to hide the fact that she had to work Christmas day. We were told that check-in time was 3 PM, and we explained that we had requested earlier check-in. She said that nothing was recorded on the records, and that whoever said that they would try to provide early check-in had no authority to do so. When I said that this was an internal matter that did not concern us, she said that electricians were checking out all of the rooms and that there was no room available.  While my wife once again reviewed the circumstances of our stay, I went to the business card display and found your business cards. At this point, the clerk found a room, prepared the keys, gave us the check-in spiel, and directed us to room 247.  We have stayed at your hotel on a number of occasions. and this is the first time that we had any difficulties with your hotel.

It's right off of the exit and is great if you are staying in North Barrie. And that's about all the good things.  At check-in, I waited 10 minutes while the clerk talked on the phone. After that, myself and my toddler walked to our room which was non-smoking but had to walk through a whole smoking section - absolutely disgusting. The place smells bad.  The next day, I put on a Do Not Disturb sign as I had a lot of stuff out for my toddler and just didn't want service. I returned to see the sign was tossed aside and my room was entered anyway. This is a violation of privacy.  Then at night-time there was a huge party across the hall and when I called the front desk they sounded super annoyed that I called - they should be annoyed with the party and not me.  Also, there was a fire alarm at 11 pm and had to wake up my toddler and go outside in minus -20 weather - this one is not their fault obviously but an inconvienence to an otherwise awful experience.  So all in all, a horrible hotel. If you want a cheaper hotel, maybe try the Howard Johnson or otherwise spend a bit more and get the Holiday Inn which is a ton better.

For example 50 cents here .. $1 there .. etc that we did not know what they were for but were charged anyway.  3. A day after we checked in at the hotel my cell phone started ringing off the hook from different companies in the US and overseas trying to sell me stuff, which leads me to believe that they sell out your number to these companies illegally to make more money themselves.  4. The wifi was not good at all, it kept connecting and disconnecting us.  5. The beds were uncomfortable and hard, which caused much tossing and turning for the both of us.  6.

You can easily walk to malls and too many restaurants and fast food joints to mention. When we called Barrie Taxi to go downtown, they were there in 5 minutes. The staff on the desk were pleasant and helpful, also very approachable when we had questions. We decided last minute to stay an extra night and it wasn't a problem and we didn't have to change rooms. Before you go in to register, bring along your licence plate number because it is required at check in, and bring your credit card if you booked online. We stayed in the smoking section (hallelujah!) in room 131. I didn't know they still existed and was very pleased. The ice and vending machines are right down the hall through double doors. We never heard a thing. The smoking section's hallway didn't stink. The room didn't either and everything was nice, clean and comfortable. The bathroom had body/hair shampoo in a shower dispenser as well as a conditioner. There were also bars of soap and a blow dryer. Even though there were only 2 of us, we were left 4 clean sets of white towels, including face cloths. The water pressure was fine and there was plenty of hot water. The heater/fan worked great. Our window, on the first floor, looked onto the parking lot and we could park right there. We really enjoyed the pool and hot tub. We had them for the most part to ourselves. They were clean but dated. The room is completely tiled and they need an overhaul, but the water was clean! Plenty of swimming towels are provided and there's a bin for the used ones. There's also a clean washroom with a shower with liquid soap. Some idiots vandalised the pool area during our stay. When we arrived for a swim one evening, the culprits were already gone. They ripped out the artificial plants and pulled safety equipment off the walls. They even tore a sign off the wall. They also left wet towels lying all over. I cleaned everything up as best I could. Apparently they returned later that night (after hours) and did it again! I can't understand why adults (yes they were) would behave this way! Someone should install security cameras, safely out of reach I might add. These same idiots also kept us up till 4:am on our last night because they kept bringing their drama into the hallway. Ugh! When they were in their rooms where they belonged, we couldn't hear a peep. We told the staff about this the next day. They were very apologetic. They were also very upset by the state of the pool area again that morning and hopefully dealt with these morons.  Our room had two double beds. They obviously weren't new but they were comfortable. There is a decent TV with limited channels but I only watched CBC once in awhile anyway. The wifi worked fine. All the better for googling directions because we were out and about all weekend. The free breakfast was fine. There was yogurt, fruit, cereal, milk, juice, bagels, bread and a toasting machine. There was also a free coffee machine nearby, which I used after hours. I thought we really got a lot for our money staying here, and aside from the riff raff, our stay exceeded our expectations. A big thank you to the hard-working women at the desk! We'll happily come back the next time we're in Barrie.

We really needed a comfortable bed and a place to shower up! There was a little buffet each morning for breakfast. The room was pretty basic and dated. Staff was not over friendly, but alright.   I have to mention one thing. I booked this hotel because the intersection we needed for the arena was on Bayfield, so we thought this would be handy. So, for starters, there was road construction going on right in front of the building, so that made driving in and out slower. Also, after we had already checked in, we found out that we were on Bayfield and the arena was actually on Bayview. So, my fault but we would not have chosen to stay here if we had known better. There were other hotels closer.   Sorry, one other thing I just remembered. A guy was cooking in the parking lot on a Bar B Q. I am guessing he is staff, but found that strange.

Secondly, we settled into our room and when it came time for me to take a shower, I noticed that the drain plug had been broken off and was just sitting over the drain hole. I took it out of the bathtub so as to not have it sliding around the bottom of the tub. When I started running the water a huge amount of hair came out from the drain hole (which I thought was very disgusting) and that was when I became aware that the bathtub drain was clogged.

The pool is over chlorinated and all 3 of the boys we were with, had burning eyes hours after they had left the pool, even after we rinsed them with fresh water. The rooms are in need of upgrading but this could be overlooked if the beds were comfortable, which they were not. The mattresses are in DIRE need of replacing. They are thin and the most uncomfortable mattresses I have ever had to sleep on or rather not get any sleep on. Oh, and you may want to bring your own pillow because theirs are pretty much like sleeping on a towel. There's not a lot to them. We had 8 people staying in 3 rooms and each room is in need of a serious deep cleaning or at the very least the carpets seriously need to be replaced. The housekeeper was very nice, however, once the room is vacated by the previous people I don't think the room goes through a heavy duty cleaning...we found a pair of black dirty socks left behind by the previous people in the corner of the room by the armoire when we arrived, which really had me questioning the cleanliness of the room.

When all was finished I asked a friend of mine who had been checked out by the same lady if this had happened to her as I found it odd because it has never happened before, she said it had not happened to her and the lady was nice to her both times. I did not appreciate being treated like some common criminal that was going to destroy an already awful hotel. The ice machine was out of order, the key cards took multiple tries to get to work on the back doors and the hotel door. The hot tub didn't work and the hallways and stairwells smelt terrible.

If you are fussy this place is not for you. I was not so concerned about the hotel having up to date decor or an extreme clean appearance or real home made eggs instead of from a package preparation, but what I was really disappointed with was the cleaning lady services. Like I mentioned I'm not fussy but I stayed here for three days and on day one there was no hair conditioner in my room so before I left I politely asked the cleaning lady in the hall to refill dispensers the shampoo was almost on empty as well . When I returned the two beds were made the towels were changed but the garbage was not emptied and the dispensers were not filled. On the second day after after being gone out all day we returned to a room that had not been cleaned at all, the beds were a mess , there were 4 of us in the room and all our towels were wet,we were still out of both shampoo and conditioner and now low on toilet paper. I had to put my own trash out! I also noticed that on one of the beds the bed sheets and pillow cases were on inside out, this made me wonder if a previous costumer had done this and if the sheets had been actually washed??

The breakfast is okay but good enough to get you on your way.   It can certainly use updating - rooms are tired, so are the beds, towels and linens.   The Problem - do not expect any sleep if you are there on a Friday to Sunday. This hotel attracts the local teens and early 20 something year olds to use it as a base before and after they go to the bars, which are all within walking distance. The get drunk before and certainly are drunk, loud and belligerent when they return between 1am - 3am. They have 2 security guards, who quite frankly, cannot keep up with the noise and drunkards. I felt that they are in an unsafe environment. The person at the front desk cannot help.   They need to develop a better protocol on how to keep their guests away from the noise and a better way to not put their employees in harms way.

Staff couldn't of cared the least of our disappointment when checking out as all I got was a managers card slammed down in front of me cause I was holding up line of hung over bar growers.   Ha don't bother call manager cause they won't call you back, as I complained yet still no response.  guess after this place had a double murder in it that's all they care about is bar goers what a dump. This is all true no need to make anything up if you have $129 to waste then go for it but if you don't stay some where else.

Pool itself was warm..water seemed clean..but the pool tiles etc need a good scrub down..it did not overally appealing. In the morning for our breakfast they had a small but good variety of things. We were waiting for breakfast to have a homeless man come in..stood behind him while he emptied both coffee pots in a wine bottle..there for didnt have any coffee..then he proceeded to poor apple juice into two cups there..and chug them..all while we are waiting..then walked over and helped himself to some fruit and walked out. I am all for helping the homeless..but as a paying costumer..and breakfast ending at 9..it would be great if they could wait until then and allow them to come in and enjoy breakfast..wasnt very professional.

Not impressed. The room was very dated and only somewhat clean. Sheets, blankets, bathroom clean, but the bed skirt and the walls could use a wash! There were only thin blankets on the beds, no comforters so we were a little on the chilly side. We were put in a room on the first floor at the back of the hotel which was close to the pool but a fair distance from the lobby. Also, our room had 1 queen bed with a pullout couch which was terribly uncomfortable. We will not be returning to this hotel.

(Ontario's ministry of health has been notified.) The rooms smell like urine and mildew upon entering, the carpet is dirty, stained, and sticky, the linens and towels are gray and unhygienic (what are they washed in? Mud?) and while looking for towels the next morning, a USED VAGINAL CLEANSING PRODUCT (DOUCHE) FROM A PREVIOUS GUEST WAS FOUND IN THE BATHROOM!  When I immediately reported it to the management, they blithely shut the door to the breakfast eating room (who would eat at such a dirty place!?!) and blandly asked me if I wanted $10 off (no apologies, no look of surprise from the staff) and asked me why I didn't complain when I arrived. I explained that we had arrived at 2:30 am and were too exhausted to do a thorough exam on the room and that only this morning, while looking for towels did I find the used feminine hygiene product. I insisted on a full refund, stating that having used products that are inserted into the body left in their rooms are considered hazardous to the public (um, body and blood exposure...what if a kid found this and began playing with it?) and there is never an excuse for such poor housekeeping. THE CLERK / OWNER THEN ACCUSED ME OF PLANTING THE DIRTY DOUCHE MYSELF! I WAS SHOCKED and told him he ought to be ashamed of himself. Bad management and horrible housekeeping does not give them the right to attack and blame their innocent guests.  In addition, I listed the more vague areas of uncleanliness like the condition of the sheets, towels, floors, and carpet and strong urine and mildew smells. I stressed that had we arrived at a decent hour and not so tired we wouldn't have stayed at such a dirty, nasty place. Finally, during check-in, the night clerk attempted to charge me more than the reservation amount that was placed on their website of Wyndham.com and I had to prove the guaranteed price with a copy of the website reservation page, and he then claimed his ""system was now down."" I should have noticed the red flag right that this was a disreputable hotel but one's common sense isn't strong at 2:30am when one just needs sleep. I wish we had just slept in the car. We will dispute the charges with our credit card company, but to you fellow travelers, beware of this place and stay somewhere else.",1,negative

The room was AWFUL - - -it was tiny, the carpet was filty and stained, the windows wire filthy, all of the door handles and door frames were crusty. There was even a phone number written in big , black numerals on the wall. The door showed evidence that it had been possibly forced open at some poinbt. I didn't want to unpack my stuff on any surfaces. I decided to leave. The front desk was very helpful as I wouldn't have gotten a refund . They offered to show me an upgraded room and bump me up if I was okay to stay. The new room was marginally better - - at least more like a regular hotel room. Still dated and strong smell of room air cleaner but....I stayed. Unfortunately, that part of Barrie is rife with prositutes and the drug trade so....lots of questionable folks walking around.I'm a woman travelling alone so I locked myself in at 7:30 pm and didn't leave till morning. I will not go back!!

116173399,barrie/ca/154980/246958/116173399.html,Knights Inn Barrie,"Most of the reviews I have written for Trip Advisor are positive in nature; intended to identify a hidden gem or confirm why a place has such a high rating. Rarely is a negative review of much use because there are already so many good places identified by fellow travelers, but occasionally a place is so bad that there is a real duty to warn others to stay away under all circumstances. Such was the case with the HoJos in Barrie. It was also a good lesson in using the technology available to avoid such mistakes in the future.  I was in Toronto for a one day golf tournament just outside the city in a rural area with no accommodations nearby. I wasn’t sure how long the event would last so I decided to play it by ear and not book a spot in advance, not being sure of where I would end up that night. As it turned out the event ended in the early afternoon and I decided to drive up the Barrie, which I remembered as a nice little city on Lake Simcoe from years before. Naively I assumed there would be some type of accommodation down on the extensive waterfront from which I could explore the area on foot and so I took the old highway into town rather than the 400 expressway. Wrong! A half hour of driving the waterfront revealed nothing but a small B&B which is not my thing. Deciding to head out the 400 interchanges where I knew there would be plenty of the usual chains I came across the HoJo by accident. It was within easy walking distance of the waterfront so I decided to give it a try – there were quite a few cars in the parking lot.  My first doubts were raised by the clerk who was on the phone on an obviously personal call. He didn’t seem to want to break it off so the check in took an inordinate amount of time with him writing down information that any other place would input into a computer. Getting my key, only after replacing my Visa with interact because the clerk didn’t seem to know how to work the former, I headed to my room on the second floor of the motel structure. After walking across an area of dead grass covered with dog feces I encountered a set of concrete steps that was so rotten and decrepit that I seriously considered not climbing them; having done so I now saw that the steps had set the pattern for the general state of maintenance of the entire place. There were broken chunks of concrete, gaping holes in the overhanging roof, unidentifiable stains that could have been paint, blood or bird droppings and air conditioners literally hanging from the windows.  Arriving at my room I noticed I was directly overhead of a crowd that looked like refugees from the Trailer Park Boys – beer bottles, bad music, smoke and profanity were the order of the day. The room was not as bad as expected – the strong smell of disinfectant drowned out what I thought would greet my nostrils, one of the lights worked, and the carpet stains and burns were no worse than any flophouse. However, the bed looked ominous. I pulled back the sheets and found the name of another motel on them. Suddenly, all I could think of was ‘bed bugs! In truth I didn’t see any, but maybe that was because I got out my computer and thanked God that the wireless internet worked, booked another place on Trip Advisor and got the hell ought of there before I found out.  The moral of the story is that all I had to do was look at the Trip Advisor app on my iPhone or stop at an internet café; this could have saved me the horrors of this place and I would be $85.00 richer.",1,negative

If this is the last hotel in Barrie, DO NOT stay there(which it probably will be since they turn away business). I attempted to stay at this hotel in june 2011. I had stayed there before, while visiting a friend. It is not the best place (was always kinda dirty), but convenient. I booked two rooms (which took over four hours between them not returning my call and not understanding english). One for me and my boyfriend, and one for my best friend and her boyfriend. They drove from Sault Ste marie, and we came from St Catharines. Not a short trip for anyone. After our day together, I attempted to check in around 5pm. When we showed up there was a cricket game going on in the parking lot (they obviously care about their customers vehicles). Some other customer was frustrated with the clerk, and left in a huff, and when I give my name it is ""not on file for a reservation"" But since I SPELLED it out, I was pretty sure they got it right. When I gave my credit card, the number was on file under a different name. The clerk, who was wearing a ""mr lazy"" tee shirt then had to go get the manager, because he wasn't sure if the two rooms under my credit card were for me???!!!!????!!!!!! The manager came in (I suspect from the cricket game?) and looked at the computer, then started to ask for ALL MY INFO ALL OVER AGAIN (name, phone number, address, etc)... I was getting frustrated, I just wanted to check in and get back to spending time with my friend who I hadn't seen in six months.... why was this taking so long. Were the employees THAT incompetent. WHY did you need to go over this with me AGAIN????? I swore, because I was angry, and the manager YELLED at me. Told me not to swear, and to get out of his hotel, and go someplace else! Well, sadly, there were no other hotels. My best friend stayed on an air mattress at our friends house, and my boyfriend and I drove (later that night) to Collingwood, where luckily his parents were staying. Did I mention it was my friend's birthday??? My friend could have stayed there, but she did not want to give this hotel her money either. When I emailed the company to complain, the Manager was supposed to reply, he never did! When I wrote again, someone from home office offered me 50 bucks off my stay, but frankly, I wouldn't stay at this hotel if you paid me! I recommend you don't either!",1,negative

When we inquired about this being a non-smoking building, the staff at the front desk reassured us that smoking was allowed outside only. He offered to show us a room, after some indecision with another staff member as to which one we would see, and we were more undecided when we entered the room. The smell of smoke was very evident. As all other major chain hotels in Barrie were fully booked, we decided to give it a try (BIG MISTAKE).   Our room was on the ground floor, facing the parking lot, almost next door to a very noisey bar. Patrons of the bar came and went all night, from the hotel rooms surrounding us, until 4:00 a.m. the next morning. Needless to say, we didn't get much sleep.  Continental breakfast was offered to us (6:00-10:00 a.m.). When we arrived at the breakfast room at 7:30 a.m., there was no coffee or bagels, the juice machine was not working. Staff was insulted when we asked if we could at least get a cup of coffee.  If anyone plans to stay there, take an employee of the Health & Safety Dept. with you.",1,negative

We stayed near the west side of the first floor, and the now closed neighbouring restaurants' patio framing was really rough and old looking. The concrete flooring beside the room was busted up - the overhang for the 2nd floor walkway is rotting underneath and needs repair and paint. The air conditioner doesn't fix properly and we stuffed napkins in the exposed area to keep the bugs out. Also, someone had not vaccuumed properly and there were several glass shards beside and under the bed which simply means someone did not do their job right and take the time to vaccuum properly. It smelled as if there was beer spilled recently beside the bed but once the air got circulating the smell left pretty quickly.  All in all, this property has great potential and from we experienced, a solid front desk staff - it just needs some upgrading and proper housekeeping and maintenance care.

When we came back to sleep, we realized there was blood stain on the sheet and more on a pillow. During the night we were woke up by the sound of water falling from the ceiling. There was a lot of water, apparently the person on the second floor took a shower and something was broken because the shower was actually draining in our room.  We spoke with the manager who told us he had only one room left so we went to that room. I decided to inspect it before moving in. The first thing I realize was the smell, it had a relent of urine in the air. I opened the bed to check the sheet, and again blood stain, on the second bed (this room had 2 queen bed) there was a big spot of mold in the sheet.  At that point, it was more than I could handle!

He returned a second time with clean pillow cases a little later.  Then I discovered there was only one towel in the bathroom. Only one bath towel, no hand towels and no face cloths. The towels that I finally got did not smell fresh and were thread-bear.  The room smelled musty and the paint was peeling all over the room, especially the ceiling. The bathroom was not very clean, in my opinion. We were also concerned that the smoke alarm/fire detector was not properly mounted to the ceiling. It was hanging from the wires instead of being properly fastened to the ceiling as it should be.  I and my wife hardly slept all night. Other occupants near our room were noisy and rowdy most of the night, In fact, someone must have called the police because a patrol car showed up around midnight and talked to all the rowdy people in the parking lot and in some of the rooms near us. The management didn't do anything to quiet the other occupants.  In the morning we couldn't stomach the smell in the lobby to stay and have breakfast there and the breakfast area was not very clean.

When I arrived at your hotel back in September of 2012, I was just out of school and travelling alone across the country for a job contract. I had previously been travelling to Vietnam and Thailand and no where did I feel as unsafe as I did when I stayed at your hotel.   I was greeted by the manager by rudely exclaiming that I in fact did not have a reservation. I then tried to convince you that I did indeed have a booking that I made through your website and I even had a booking number. You told me a few more times that I did not have a booking. I then went on to ask if you had any availabilities and you told me that you wouldn't be able to tell for another hour because you didn't know what rooms were clean or not. I then asked if I could leave my bags with you as I had no vehicle and you sharply said that it wasn't safe at this hotel so I couldn't leave my bags behind. I then asked him if he had a map of the area as this was my first time in Barrie and I didn't know where to go for the hour with all my bags until my reservation could be sorted out. He told me no.   I then set out on my way with all my bags on my back and walked the streets of Barrie for the hour with many unnerving encounters with men trying to get me into their vehicles as well as with people attempting to sell me drugs. I was very worked up but couldn't return to the hotel or to the room that I had booked online.   I ended up returning to the hotel and eventually getting in to a room (which was not cleaned properly but I didn't care at this point). Breakfast was supposed to be available the next day but no food was left by the time I got there at 9:00am.   I left Barrie with a very sour taste in my mouth. As a young female traveller I felt very disrespected and unsafe in my own country.  I hope for the sake of future guests at your hotel that you revise your customer service plan.",1,negative

I have stayed at Hotel before because it is close to downtown Barrie and most times has some empty rooms. I have stayed at this Hotel at least two or three times over the last few years and despite its good location there are several short comings that never change and some new problems that have occurred on my last two stays. First of all my last trip cost me almost $90.00 a night after taxes so I begin to expect more from hotel. The hotel rooms are usually visibly clean, but I have seen electrical outlets hanging out of walls,lights that are not plugged in or bulbs that are blown or not even there. Sometimes table lamps are near worn out and flickering. On my last stay the bedspread had visible cigarette burn marks on them. Also on my last stay the baseboard heater in the bathroom was partially assembled with wire hanging out. I am unsure if it worked. On this stay the toilet seat would not stay up on its own and the bathroom door was missing a door jam and would not stay fully closed. In short the hotel rooms need to be seriously checked and worn,broken and missing items need to be replaced. Now for the two most recent issues from my last two trips, #1 On my last trip I booked my room for three or four days. On day one when I returned to my room my room key did not work and when I entered with help from staff ie. card reprogramming my room had been partially cleaned. Apparently cleaners left for the day leaving my bed sheetless,etc. I had to have night hotel staff setup my room so I could use it. #2 On my trip between Christmas and New Years 2012 when I came back to my room after day one, also booked for three nights my hotel key did not work and I had to have it reprogrammed by staff and when I got into my room cleaners had not even been there. These are only a few issues that come to mind.

When he arrived he asked for a room with a fridge because he brings food for the week. We had just done the same thing with a Howard Johnson in Hamilton and they had no problem giving him a room with a fridge. THIS hotel refused to do so. They claimed we could have to cancel our reservation (thus getting charge a FULL night's stay) and book a room with a fridge FOR MORE MONEY!!!! $30 EXTRA! Again, the one in Hamilton had no problem with this, nor did they charge extra money.  When I phoned Expedia to cancel, I was informed of the cancellation fee and I explained to them why I was cancelling, so she called the hotel to try to get them to waive the fee and they would not!  So we cancelled and my husband went to a much nicer hotel with kinder staff! I cannot believe the way we were treated. All other Howard Johnson's have been amazing!

The bathroom was moldy with cracked tiles and even some missing in spots. The glass in the bathroom window was broken and had been TAPED back together. Both voices and footsteps from adjacent rooms as well as the room above could be heard throughout the night. My husband and I would rather sleep in our car than spend another night at this hotel. I can not believe Howard Johnson allows to keep this hotel to keep such low standards. I phoned the manager and all he would do is offer a discount on my next stay.....no thank you!!",1,negative

184589420,barrie/ca/154980/246958/184589420.html,Knights Inn Barrie,"I wish there was a rating of 0 because this place doesn't deserve even a 1.  I complained with the letter below (plus photos) and received a full refund. At least the staff were pleasant in the exchange about my complaint. The letter:  On July 27, 2013, my husband and I had a booking at the Howard Johnson in downtown Barrie, Ontario.  Though your website claims that your locations are ""for value-conscious families and business travelers who are looking for reasonably priced accommodations"", the state of the room, the hotel, and the breakfast options go beyond reasonably priced, and dips far into atrocious and neglected, and probably illegal.  Let me illustrate: First and foremost, we requested a non-smoking room. When I opened the door, it reeked of smoke. While it was likely now a non-smoking room, this had clearly been a smoking room for years upon years, and those with sensitivities like we have should not be subjected to that residual smell and told outright that the room used to be a smoking room.  I began to inspect the room and felt an odourless but oily residue on all surfaces. I suspect this might have been a cleaning solution, but it took several tissues to wipe it all off. It was disgusting.  In the bathroom, the sink faucet handle was broken off and barely worked (see attached), the shower stall faucet handle was broken off and barely worked AND there were marks on the bottom of shower stall that clearly indicates that this has been happening for some time (see attached). As well, there were three holes in the drywall, aligned vertically (see attached). There was nothing to hang a towel on, and there were no bath towels (I had to call to get some, and they were delivered within the hour).  Back in the room itself, the overloaded power bar posed a danger with everything, including the mini fridge, plugged into it. A handle on the credenza was missing (see attached), the cover for the battery compartment of the tv remote control was missing (see attached), and there were cigarette stains on the sheets and pillow cases (see attached) as well as on the telephone. The bed creaked and was off centre. The ceiling tiles showed obvious leak damage. The only way to close the curtains blocked the air conditioner.  And it didn't stop there. Breakfast the next morning was all carbs, except for WEEK OLD expired yogurt (see attached). No fruit, no hardboiled eggs, not even jam for the toast. It was cereal, toast, and waffles. That's it. Beverages were water, milk, and orange juice that clearly came from a powder. Not even fresh juice or juice from concentrate. Juice made from powder (shows that you clearly don't care about your patrons. The cereal dispenser was broken, the waffle iron didn't work well, and the tables needed cleaning. Plus, for as few people as were in the hotel, eating with only plastic utensils also shows that you would rather spend as little as possible.  And to end our stay, there were dirty diapers, cans, and other garbage strewn across the parking lot.  There was absolutely nothing about our stay that was enjoyable, and everything was despicable. This property is shameful and disgusting. That's 22 issues that I discovered within the first 10mins of being there, and expired yogurt and overloaded power bars could have had dangerous consequences.   Is this what your want your chain to be like? Is this the reputation you want for your company?   I expect a full refund. Please advise how you will send that to me.

My wife and nephew were really happy with the location of the motel. It was the only one near the down town and watching santa clause parade from across the street was a pleasant experience with family and friends. The only thing I was not pleased about was weather and drunk people on down town street. There is also a restaurant next to the motel and the buffet at restaurant was really yummy. I enjoyed fishing at creek passing through the parking lot. Twenty four hour service including housekeeping and room service were some of the convenient facilities that helped us to spend time with family and we were free to as for service when we want and didn't have to worry for morning knock on the door when kids were sleeping. They also offers continental breakfast at morning 6 to 9 am. The staff was really friendly and helpful. Free parking also helped to save money and can park right at the door of room and wonderful open area for kids to play. Building was old but preety looking and nicely managed. Clean place to stay and nice interior was really attractive.

Upon entering the room it reaked of stale cigarette smell which room was non smoking floor was filthy electrical socket couldn't hold plug in to use coffee maker the entire room was heavily run down. The entire night was spent awake with rowdy drunken teenagers yelling and fighting during the early morning hours until finally police were called to handle the disturbance resulting in two arrests which the manager did nothing to compensate the poor unsuspecting patrons who rented a room for that night. I would never set foot in that disgusting place again and would never recommend it to anyone not even my worst enemy that's how bad this place is. Sleep in your car it's much safer by far.

The attendant was so understanding and empathetic to my situation. I'm a tiny 22 year old girl, I was alone, and he made me feel extremely safe. He even offered to text/call my parents for me to tell them where I was, so they wouldn't be worried. He also offered to walk me to my room to make sure I got in safe, told me to lock the doors, etc. I can't stress enough how this hotel visit changed me. Never again will I pass someone stranded on the road, or not show kindness to strangers.  As for the room, it was clean and bright. I was surprised how much light the lamps let off. The bedding was clean and comfortable, the curtains were a little old but like my dad always said, the most important fabrics are the ones closest to your body.

Well located near downtown though depressingly ugly, this HoJo offers a clean and spacious room at a decent price. (Ask for a second-storey room, I suggest.) Staff were pleasant enough in what is probably not a terrific job.  The bed was comfortable enough, and the shower worked well. A pleasing view of green out the big front window was somewhat mitigated by bent bars outside the bathroom window. A strong chemical smell (cleaning fluids?) on arrival had mostly dissipated six hours later, after we left windows open as much as possible. We didn't mind the uneven floors, and it had a decent table and chairs.  The included ""continental"" breakfast was a plus, with cereals, make-your-own waffles, toast and yogurt. Cafeteria-quality coffee is unavoidable, I assume, but fruit juice instead of coloured sugary water would have been nice. Drawback: even on Sunday, breakfast is offered only till 9 a.m., though check-out isn't until 11.  Not HoJo's fault: Barrie tap water tastes terrible.",3,negative

Needless to say, we didn't even bother staying, even though they wouldn't do anything for a refund. We just left!

360896291,barrie/ca/154980/246958/360896291.html,Knights Inn Barrie,"So I decided to stay at this hotel on a Friday in spite of some of the bad reviews I read and I'm glad I did. I've driven past this hotel many times and the outside is always clean and there's plenty of parking spaces. As for the complaints others left about noise, you booked a stay at a hotel on a Main Street in a city, of course there will be noise just like you get street noise at any hotel you stay at in Barrie. It is conveniently located close to the downtown area and access to Hwy 400. I've heard more noise at the more expensive hotels in town (and I've stayed at them all at least once before) than I did last night at the Knights Inn. Great value because the rooms are clean, the beds are comfortable and you get a continental breakfast included with the room rate. What you don't get is the noise of other guests partying in the hallways that echo, kids playing floor hockey in the hallways, the noise of the elevator pinging all night long, other guests slamming their room doors and talking loudly in the hallways at 7am as they either go down for breakfast or check out early. Next time I stay in Barrie, I will stay here again. any noise I did here was minimal and easily cancelled out when I put on my earbuds to listen to music as I drifted off to sleep. So, if you want to save on expenses and get a good nights sleep, stay here. If street noise really bothers you, spend a buck on a pair of ear plugs. If you want a five star hotel experience, stay at a five star hotel and pay a five star price.
 
 
 Room Tip:  2nd floor is accessed by outside stairs. Book a room on main floor if stairs are an issue for you.

It was a very spacious unit, with a large living room, kitchen, bathroom, bedroom and back porch.  The unit really felt like a home away from home. The furniture was clean and comfortable, with a cabin-like feel, and the staff were very friendly and helpful. It was a nice place to return to after a day trip to Toronto or a drive through the rolling Ontario countryside. We also appreciated that the unit was stocked with paper towels, dish soap, detergent and other items that can be a hassle to purchase, but which some condos do not stock.  The kitchen supplies, like dishes and utensils, were adequate -- in a college dorm room sort of way. If you cook with specialty tools, you'll need to bring them along.  Carriage Hills really is in the middle of nowhere, and there are only a handful of local restaurants and stores. We didn't mind the peace and quiet at all, but this probably isn't the place to stay if you're hoping to eat at a different five-star restaurant every night.  We only had one complaint about the resort. The units have large whirlpool tubs that are very comfortable -- but also very loud. The resort has quiet hours between 11 p.m. and 7 a.m., and it asks guests not to use the tub jets during that time. But people don't always comply, and the noise might interfere with your sleep if you go to bed early, sleep late or want to take a nap.  The resort does have wireless access available, at a cost of $10 (U.S.) per 24-hour block. Hopefully the resort will stop charging for this service before too long, since even Holiday Inns now offer the service for free.",4,positive

The complex is sort of out in the sticks, about 15 miles or so from downtown Barrie but it is very easy to drive there. The grounds are beautiful and well maintained and the staff is very helpful. Highly recommend getting directions from the locals, they know all the shortcuts. Also stop at the IGA on the way in for drinks and snacks-the complex has no restaurant and the restaurants at the nearby resorts are very expensive. It is worth the drive nto barrie to eat dinner.

5923071,barrie/ca/154980/260333/10063539.html,Carriage Hills Resort,"We went to Carriage Ridge for one night for a wedding...the wedding was actually at Horseshoe, but the room at Carriage Ridge was $70 cheaper.  We didn't spend a lot of time in the room or at the resort, but from what we saw we really liked it.  We had a studio room which consisted of a king size bed, a living area with a pullout couch, and a small kitchen area. It was all one big room. The kitchen had a toaster oven, mircowave, and fridge. Had we known this beforehand, we would have brought some snacks.  The room also had a spacious balcony with 2 chairs on it.  The only thing missing was a tub....there was a big shower stall.  Overall our stay was uneventful and I'd definitley recommend this to others. In fact we were talking about going up there for New Years or a ski weekend.   The only negatives (which are minor) is that it was very difficult to find the reception desk when we got there. The sign that pointed to Carriage Ridge led us to the suites, but not to reception. We had to get out of the car (in the rain) and ask for directions at the rec centre. The reception isn't far...it just would have been nice to have known where to go! On the bright side, you can check out from your room, which saves a lot of time!  The other negative doesn't have to do with the resort, but with the area. There is NOTHING there!! We wanted a quick bite to eat, and we would have had to go to Barrie. Besides the restaurants at Carriage Ridge and Horseshoe Resort, the only other place to go is the IGA. So if you want something on the run, make sure it pick it up on your way from Barrie, or bring something that you can make in your room.  Right next to the IGA is the LCBO and the Beer Store.

Unless you bring up your own bikes to ride around, there really isn't much for them to do. There is only an indoor pool and indoor hot tub, adults enjoy being outdoors as well as children, they should have built an outdoor facility as well.  They should have some sort of camp for these kids to keep busy, but not movies, hemp, make your own sundae. Why not something like rock climbing, scavenger hunts etc.... there is a lot of land space to accomodate that. We pay enough yearly, I'm sure they could find the cash to fund something like this.

Staff were very inflexible with the check-in time (4 p.m.) despite the fact that we had nowhere else to go. We went to the Carriage House - their recreation area. The pool was packed, and the rest of their recreation area was just an empty area with tables and chairs and an arcade area. After several hours waiting around we called again to urge them to let us in early, which they did - at 3:45. Rooms were nice, if somewhat dated. However, as other reviewers noted, they don't really seem to make an effort to keep parties that reserve together, in the same location. As a result, our one-bedroom suite was not adjacent to our relatives, but 20-something party animals. We had to call security twice, once for loud music after 11 p.m., and another time for slamming doors, shouting and general carrying on between 2:30-3 a.m. They came promptly, but of course noise started again once security left. This was exacerbated by the walls, which seemed paper thin. We were offered a rather insincere apology at check-out. Certainly, a hotel isn't responsible for the noise of the other guests, but what they do about it. Surely they could have put the ""fear of god"" into them the first time and threaten ejection for repeated noise (they didn't - we heard exactly what security said both times, which was along the lines of ""knock it off."").

They own a one-bedroom with private accomodation for two and a kitchen. We were travelling with another couple and had booked at another resort. There was a mix-up and we were booked into a studio unit. The only solution RCI could come up with was to send us to Carriage Hills and set us up in two studio units side by side. They were side by side but we needed to go down a flight of stairs, down a sidewalk, across the front of the building, down another sidewalk to get from one unit to the other. The room looked nice enough but was not very practical. The ""kitchen"" consisted of a bar fridge, microwave, sink and counterspace that was too small to even hold a dinner plate. There was no place to put our clothes. No stand for the suitcase, no dresser drawers and the only closet was a small broom closet that also held the garbage. We were told on check - in that the room was designed for four adults. The room had a king sized bed and a double pull-out. We went to our friends unit with the expectation of having a visit and enjoying a game of cards. There was no table and no chairs. All they had was those collapsable TV tables. We set those up and brought in some wooden Muskoka chairs that were outside on the deck. Even then when one of us had to go to the bathroom or the so-called kitchen we had to crawl over the bed in order to get there. The concierge called us the next morning to welcome us and ask if there was anything they could do for us. I asked for a card table and perhaps a chair or two, because we enjoyed playing cards in the evening. I was told that we could go to the Carriage House and play there. We were then invited to an information session the next morning to find out what all the resort had to offer and to enjoy breakfast (on them). We arrived to a wonderful breakfast of coffee and muffins!!! And were then subjected to a long speal about why we should buy into their time share. I told them I wasn't too impressed with the time share and that we were there because a family member who is a owner had gifted us their week and that we were supposed to be in a one-bedroom unit with a kitchen and ended up in two studios with no kitchen.

During the day the only activities available are to rent a bike or to go horseback riding, or lounge in the pool. There is little to do at night other than watch an analog television with limited channels, or pay $5.00 to rent a video. This is a very isolated resort. You will have to drive in congested traffic over a hundred miles to get to Toronto or even further to get to Niagara Falls. I drove over 400 miles to get to this resort, in hindsight there is nothing at this resort to justify the time it takes to get here and return home. There are many better resorts closer to home.

We did not go to the kids craft activity and opted to take the kids for pony rides instead off site at Highview Farms which was about a 15 minute drive away. If you like horses, Highview Farms is a beautiful equestrian facility and I would recommend a visit there. We actually spent 2 days there walking around & petting the horses. There were  no other activites at Carriage Hills so we went to Horseshoe resort which has a kids activity park. But the activities were geared to older kids and the zip line was full. You also can only reserve the zip line in person and not on the phone. There are no restaurants at the resort so be prepared to cook and clean up after yourself or travel into town to eat.

This is the third time we have spent a week there in the summer, and the weather this summer made it the best. The two-bedroom lock-offs are terrific for traveling with family. My mother and daughter shared the studio while my wife and other daughter took the one bedroom. Everyone had enough room, and the two balconies were nice to have. We were in a newly-renovated unit (a week earlier), and the renovations are great. If anything, the quality of appliances, cabinets, countertops and so on have been significantly upgraded, including flat-screen TVs in living area. Overall the property is as nice as always, but the pool will need to some significant renovation in the next few years. In the meantime, it's still a great place for kids to hang out. I don't golf, but clearly the golf courses in the immediate area are beautiful and look challenging. The development of the resort in the valley is good, but I wish they would create some trails from the ridge to the valley, so it wouldn't be necessary to either walk down overgrown ski hills or drive around. The community has just built two new tennis courts at the corner of Horseshoe Valley Rd, and these are available provided you purchase a ""membership"" for $10 at the pool house, and in return you get the combination to the door. This is a great deal, and the courts are in great shape. One thing I couldn't help notice is that the roofs and exterior of some buildings clearly needed work. Some work was being done already, and some had been done, so I am assuming it's just a matter of time. As for location, we used it as a base to take trips out to Midland, Coldwater, Orillia, Barrie, Collingwood and many to Wasaga Beach. The beach is truly one of the world's great beaches: powdery-soft sand that extends at least a kilometer out into the lake before it reaches above 5' deep. Great for young kids, families, all ages really. Beach Area 1/2 has loads of attractions nearby, while Beach Area 6 is much quieter, but all beaches have the same great sand, and the water in August was at least 82-85° F (29° C)--warmer than the pool at the resort! Of course, if you're interested in going farther afield, Toronto is only about 75 minutes drive away. All in all, we are still happy spending time at Carriage Hills.

Our RCI catalog listed a ""one hour"" drive to Toronto. Which I could live with. Turned out to be 1 1/2 hrs. The drive into Toronto wasn't bad, it was driving in Toronto itself that was hectic and tiring. I should have expected that. So, I don't know if I would recommend the resort with that in mind. Once at the resort itself, I wished I had booked things to do up in that area. The Adventure Park, minutes away at the Horseshoe Resort, the zip lining, etc, not to mention the golf courses available, provide lots to do near by. We went in September, so skiing was not an option, but I can easily see that the whole area must be hopping with skiers, snowmobilers etc once the snow falls. My husband and I, being in our 60's were not looking for strenuous activities, but found plenty to enjoy during our stay there. I would go again with the idea of relaxing more in the heated indoor/outdoor pool which was really cool, the sauna, the whirlpool and the spa outside. Trips into Barrie were fun and found a great outlet mall there. The 2BR suite we had was awesome! Very modern, gas fireplace, full kitchen, 2 full baths, etc. The staff was great, very pleasant and helpful throughout the week! Highly recommend this resort, especially during the winter months. BTW, we did the CN Tower, Toronto Zoo, Ontario Royal Museum, the Ontario Science Centre, (the only thing I was dissapointed in) and the Casa Loma Mansion (I liked the best!).

Ironically, this trip occurred a week after we were invited to the sales centre for a sales pitch (we were promised on the phone that they were not selling anything ""this was just a member update"") requesting we buy more property. For a moment, we considered it, but after this trip I am glad we did not. It is unfortunate, but the exterior is falling apart! When we arrived the first thing we noticed is the significant paint peeling-not a big deal considering the climate-but then I saw towels over light fixtures, being used as some sort of stop-gap repair mechanism! The back patio was a hazard. Wooden planks were stripping off the wall and floor spanning the length of the floor. My daughters got splinters using the banister to go upstairs. It is clear that no one has cleaned or maintained the exterior in a LONG time. The room itself was lovely as always. Clean and well appointed. Be prepared to wash dishes and avoid the dishwasher unless you wish to wash twice. The washing machine was just as ineffective. We had dinner at Settler's Ghost. VERY nice! The stuffed zucchini and the pasta were very well done!  The amenities were excellent - the bike ride was really fun and they had a hummer ride special which my kids loved! The pool is also well kept and clean. Good trip-YES Great trip -NO

We travelled with 2 other couples.   The cottage type with connected rooms. There is kitchen, tv, and even an ipod dock. The masterbedroom also has another tv. There is also a couch in the main area with a pull out bed.  Unfortunately we didn't have enough time to visit the pool. But we all had so much fun. First day we barbequed, the nice thing about this place is that there are shared bbqs, so you don't have to bring your own. very convenient. We ended up playing poker and cooking that night. The second day, one couple left.  We ended up buying ice cream from a very good place, I believe it was the kawartha ice cream place right close by the resort.  Same day we took advantave of a little excursion.  Horseshoe valley resort has some amazing activities.  We would have never tried it if it wasn't for the other couple (our friends). They encouraged us and we ended up zip lining!!!! it was awesome. I also, tried the OGO BALL , oh my that was quite the experience, i was so scared that i screamed too much... people working thought something went wrong...lol We also did the rock climbing and mini putting and the maze. Awesome time. We got back to the resort made dinner ate, played more poker. GOOD TIMES!  The next day we went for a walk/stroll around the cottage. very beautiful out back there is a small trail. We got back made breakfast. Another great thing about this cottage, all pots, pans, utensils, plates, dish washer, soap, washing machine, detergent. All is provided. All you have to do is bring food to cook.  Also, bathroom supplies were provided.  It was sad, but it was time leave! The most important part is that we all had a very nice time!",4,positive

The only real complaint I have is that they really didn't give enough information, and when I called the concierge to ask where to go for breakfast she gave me the name of a restaurant that didn't open until 11 a.m. Directions that the front desk gave us were inaccurate as well. We would probably go back again, just better inform ourselves to save the 5 or 6 times that we had to backtrack and rearrange plans.",4,positive

Early check-out (10am) is a down fall, but you can go and use the pool and leave later. You can borrow a lot of things at the front desk for cooking including BBQ sets.

It was warm and sunny for most of the week, so we were able to go biking and golfing all week. There is a golf course nearby called Settler's Ghost and we just loved playing it. It is very well kept. The resort itself is nice with an indoor/outdoor pool and small fitness centre although we didn't use it this time- we were too busy enjoying outside activities. We had a 1 bedroom which was plenty big enough for the two of us and gas fireplace was nice on the cooler evenings. There are gas bbq's scattered throughout the resort so we used it quite often. You definetely need a car to enjoy the area as the resort is 20-30 minutes from Barrie and Orillia which are the biggest cities nearby. There is a grocery store/liquor in Craighurst which is a 5 minute drive. I would highly recommend this resort especially in the off season. During the peak season, I've heard it is very busy and with only one pool it would be packed.",4,positive

We went cross country skiing and snow tubing at Horseshoe Valley Resort and swimming at the Resort's indoor/outdoor pool! We had a studio condo, which had a fridge, microwave, and kettle, plus all the dishware that you would need for 4 people. It was also a really large room, with a balcony. It was a great base. Within about a 5-10 minute drive, we could get to Horseshoe Resort or to the grocery store. The condo was very clean. The drawback re the swimming pool is that you have to dress in your winter layers to reach it as the condos are all separate low-rise buildings. Also, the change rooms are small and that was uncomfortable when it was at all busy. The staff were very friendly and I would definitely stay there again. There are no restaurants at the Resort so, if you were not eating in, you would have to go to Horsehoe or into the nearby little town (again it is all no more than a 10 minute drive, but the options are not vast and are even more limited on a Monday and Tuesday night when I think a few area restaurants are closed).",5,positive

Our boys enjoyed the indoor/ outdoor pool and the kids activities XBox games and Bingo. If you plan on staying in the winter there are many ski resorts near by as well as other winter activities like cross country skiing, snowshoeing dog sledding ect. If you just want to relax you can enjoy the pool. They do have a small games room with one air hockey table and a pool table and four video games, they all cost a dollar. The best time to go to the pool on the weekend is anytime before 4 or 4:30. It gets busy after that. There is an outdoor hot tub too and an exercise room that over looks the pool. We stayed in a studio. It had a mini fridge, microwave, toaster, coffee maker, kettle and a full size sink. Also there is a washer and dryer. If you stay in a one or two bedroom they have a full size kitchen. We got a peek of the room next store it was quite nice. Our unit was nice for a mini holiday for the four of us. We had a king size bed and the boys slept on the pullout couch. We enjoyed our time at Carriage Hills. If you are looking for a lot to do there are lots of activities near by.",4,positive

We went for a night of skiing and were hoping to finish it off in a cozy bar with drinks ... tough to do when you have to drive home from a bar. The attached condos were very, very noisy (80's music, drunk people at 2 am and a baby). However, it seems there is a lot to do for families, the price is low and the bed was very comfortable. We are on the fence about returning ... perhaps would have enjoyed more had we not been at blue mountain the previous weekend.

126530655,barrie/ca/154980/260333/126530655.html,Carriage Hills Resort,"Best things about resort: Nice, quiet secluded place away from the hustle and bustle of the city noise. Family oriented resort, really friendly and helpful staffs. I've been going to a lot of resorts at least twice a year and here by far is as friendly and helpful as they are going to get that I have ever seen.  Best attractions or restaurants nearby: Skiing at the Horseshoe Valley Resort is literally just at the back of the resort. If you get your lift tickets ahead of time, you can just walk it to the ski hill. Casino Rama in Orillia is only half hour away and couldn't get my wife to stay away from it. It's a good thing we were ahead in winning at the end of the week, hehehe. And when it comes to restaurants, we found Barrie which is 20 minutes south of the resort is by far your best bet because of the wide selections they offer. Far east cuisine is definitely a treat, wow...  Overall Review: Our check-in although busy, was pretty smooth and fast. The front desk people are very friendly and courteous. Very informative and they offered a lot of activities and suggestion for our stay. I called in advance to request a unit on the ground level since I have small kids and I knew that this might be a problem with the unit under us if we where ever given a top unit and to my surprised, I never even reminded them and they have given me what I asked for. The unit that were assigned to us was actually a 2 one bedroom units combine into a 1 big unit. It was clean and well kept. All TVs were already upgraded and they all have there own separate dvd players, excellent. And the resort offer free Wi-Fi as well, another excellent. And since it was 2 one bedroom units, we had ample of dishes to use in a day which allows us to do only 1 washing. The resort offer a lot of activities for the family and they give us a call almost daily to remind us of the daily activities they have. The resort never called once to solicit any time share activity. There rec center are well kept and offers a lot of activities for guests as well but if I have to critique this one, it would be that to my opinion were too small to accommodate 2 resorts. We joined the rec center twice on our stay and both time there were a lot of people in there. We had a great time nevertheless. The only down side on our stay here was the weather. Although it is nice to ski without a jacket, the warm weather doesn't help the skiing activities. Our first couple of skiing wasn't bad but as we were getting close to the trailing end of our stay, the hills were rough and slushy. We were literally skiing on slush at the bottom of the hills. It did however gave us a chance to visit Barrie and we found some good shopping and restaurants over there. By the way, I was right about my fear on my unit selection. You can definitely hear the foot steps from kids above you when they are running up and down the unit. All in all, I would definitely come here again and would definitely recommend this resort to everybody that I know.",4,positive

What I loved a little less: A little far from downtown Toronto. It was just the two of us, but it looks like it would be great for large families. The pool area looks like it will be really nice when the renovations are done, there were play areas for children and outdoor grill areas for picnics. We were given a schedule of the planned activities (for kids and adults) for the week, but unfortunately didn't have much time to participate.

I believe they are in the process of renovating the buildings and the units so ask for a newly renovated one if you have a chance. We were in a 1-bedroom unit with a fully equipped kitchen which allowed us to cook most of our meals. With 2 young kids, it's not too enjoyable to eat out anyway. there are BBQs everywhere so you can BBQ too if you wanted to.  We went during off season (mid-June) for one week. The resort was pretty empty and the 2 times that we asked for service (A/C broke down and TV didn't work), the maintenance guy came within 15 minutes. We ended up having to switch rooms because the A/C broke down but it was okay.   We got in-room massages every other day (thanks to health benefits and a great local RMT recommended by the resort!) and went swimming at the resort's indoor/outdoor pool almost every day. I even fit in a couple of workouts on the treadmill.  Since there's not much to do at the resort itself (which is a good thing!), we drove ~30 minutes each day to nearby destinations including Wasaga beach, Elmvale Jungle Zoo (we got up close to lots of animals), and Centennial Park (accessible playground and beach in Barrie). We ate at restaurants that were recommended by tripadvisor including Tiffins Curry in a Hurry and Casa Mia.  The best part: we were able to do most of our laundry before we came back with the washer/dryer there so I don't have to do a week's worth of laundry after coming back home!

They all come with a small kitchenette and the one and two bedrooms have a full kitchen.  During our recent trip to Carriage Hills we were able to use a beautiful green space surrounded by trees behind our room to play catch with our boys. We used the large indoor/outdoor swimming pool on a daily basis which also has two hot tubs and a sauna (the outdoor hot tub was under repair at the time of our visit). We all used the Jacuzzi tub which was in our one bedroom suite.  There are trails leading into the forest where you can see the true beauty of the area as well as watch tourists using the Tree Top Trekking equipment.  There are a couple of good restaurants and a grocery store nearby. There are several golf courses within a very short distance of the hotel. The staff were welcoming and friendly and quickly responded to any concerns we had about our room.

OK, we have stayed here 4 times in the last 2 years.   We have always booked a 2 bedroom, through RCI, never bought a week for more than $259 (extra vacations)!! (actually a studio with large king bed, seperated living area with double pull out couch, and an ok sized bathroom, AND this studio is combined with a 1 bedroom (the entry hall has 2 sets of doors that stay open to use the whole space..) LARGE king bedroom, large ensuite with spa tub, double sinks, seperate shower and another sink in a seperate doorway... nice sized open kitchen with 3 barstool and a dinning table that easily sits 6. opens to a living area with couch (sleeper) and 2 side chairs..TV, DVD and gas fireplace. I have done the timeshare meet, and just say no, we just walked out after our 45 minutes and our polite NO...we have friends that wanted to buy here, and went to www.buymytimeshare.com , and printed off the resale prices for this resort (reslae is about 60% less, and Carriage Hills met the reslae price!!)..don't ask, and you will not get!!  We ALWAYS ask for an upper unit, end unit...you get more windows, and a great veiw out your off living room porch, which has stairs leading to the grass area, great to start your walk off with!! The rooms are spacious, and we have NEVER had a problem sleeping 6, even 8. The hotel has a great indoor/outdoor pool which kids love!! you swim inside, and the outer wall has a glass section which has plastic flaps which you swim under/through in the cooler months, in the warmer, they remove them completely...then, voila...you are outside!! Not great in the dead of winter, the heater can not keep up to the snow, last year the pool was 70 degrees, yikes..but, we walked over (through the back trail) to the Carriage ridge, and used their pool. Aside from the large pool, they have 2 hot tubs and an amazing playground. Nice trails for walking and bike riding...take a left out of the driveway and enjoy the quiet neighborhood that was built around the resort, turn right from resort until this road ends, and you will see a life sized bear cub bronze statue catching a fish in the pond of the log home...beautiful. At the pool/rec centre, you can borrow movies, games and any kitchen tools you may need. Upstairs they have 2 pool tables (seperate rooms) and a few video games. True, the hotel does not have a restaurant, but i like to go out, so no biggie for us, and we also utulize the in room kitchen.. If you ski, drive to horseshoe valley resort day 1 and get your ski passes for the week, then on your first ski day, walk the back way from Carriage hills to Horseshoe (the rec centre will point you in the right direction) takes 4 minutes, and you are at the top of one of the Horseshe chair lifts!! When you check in, as for a room closest to this path...OR stay next door at Carriage Ridge resort (almost cookie cutter to CHills, but indoor pool, and smaller amount of units) If you have skied at HVR before, you sometimes have to walk just as far in your ski gear to get from the locker area to the lifts you want....keep you car at the hotel and walk over!! We have seen a few people wear their snow boots over, and lock their snow boots (in duffle bags) to the fence at the back of carriage hills pathway to the hill, and they ""boot up"" prior to getting on the HVR hill...no one else can walk this path but Carriage hill guests!! I like it here...quiet and close to things (Abbotts restaurant is a must, IGA is 2 KM with a LCBO/Beer Store, 20 minutes to Orrilia (walmart, loblaws, etc fast foods, hospital) Kids are always happy, and because we go often, we just walk over to use the Carriage Ridge rec centre, nicer lounge/game room, TV they give you the remote for, games and a nice pool, Just act as though you are a guest there, but they never ask. nice for a change of pace. OH, they also have little kids crafts and activities going on (cookie decorating, face painting, game time, colouring...either at Hills or at Ridge (again, the walk is really 4-5 minutes) Kids like it, and it's free. Enjoy your stay, go to Horseshoe for Silks for dinner, Loobies (next to the IGA) for some good home cooking, or Abbotts for a really nice variety of favourite, done a little differently. I will post photos later",4,positive

The studio room is very nice and the front desk ask us first if we want the bigger studio which is not updated or the updated one which is less spacious when you open the Sofabed.

Daily scheduled activities & on-site pool fun meant more rest for adults, while the kids played. The poolside patio grill offered tasty sliders, franks or burgers. In the ski park almost next door, the kids enjoyed harnessed rock climbing, running a maze or water cannon, the Euro-trampolines, and mini golf at Horseshoe Valley Adventure Park. A half hour's drive West, past the little Elmvale zoo, we stopped en route to Wasaga beach at a popular bakery facing Yummi ice cream & candy shop, beside a gift store called ""Idle Fancies"" (29 Queen St. W., Elmvale). The next day, we drove a bit over a half hour North by road 93 to Midland. A peaceful picnic spot could be found at Little Lake Park Rd. The kids enjoyed Dracula Dungeon or little Castle Village (starting at $3/adult), Huronia Museum ($36 for a family of 4 to see a 16th c. style community), Christian Martyr's Shrine garden on hwy. 12 near Talbot St. ($4/adult) and Sainte Marie Among the Hurons (excellently recreated pioneer village & educational centre with restaurant at Wye Marsh) by Discovery Harbour, just across hwy. 12 from the cathedral. Though the kids had skiied at Horseshoe Valley and Moonstone (2 exits further North in Barrie along hwy. 400 toward Midland), they hadn't experienced the local native culture or the recreational sights, such as 30,000 islands' lake cruise. Each day's excursion was a little kid's delight. Tomorrow, we'll wake from a good night's sleep under crisp sheets, to try go-karting at closeby Rounds Ranch or at Shanty Bay. Indeed, a good way to end an action-packed family get-away!

The resort was fully booked.and the staff did whatever they could to look after us to find us a room. We stayed in a one bedroom suite at the Hill...usually we stay at the Ridge. Our suite was perfect ...a separate kitchen ,a jacuzzi bathroom two double sinks, a separate shower and water closet, and lots of towels. The living room had a gas fireplace right off the kitchen We watched the Oscars enjoying eating in and sitting in front of a large TV. Laundry facilities are right off the unit  We ate at Crazy Horse Restaurant in the Horseshoe Valley Resort.. The food was good..live entertainment and only minutes away. We watched skiing from our table. There is a place to play pool ,rent movies, borrow game boards and cards. Skiing and snowboarding were all around us and our suite was perfectly quiet. Barrie and Oriliia are close by. There is a quaint village called Craighurst that has a great grocery store etc... I flew via Hamilton.It was a smooth 2 hour drive . I would recommend this Resort.

GREAT value. very spacious accommodations. we had a 1 bedroom which had a king bed + HUGE jacuzzi tub + 2 sinks, separate shower, toilet & sink area. Then there was pullout queen (not the most comfortable --- thin mattress & springs), big updated tv & dvd, in the kitchen & dining & living room area. Room backed on to golf course and was clean. Housekeeping only makes beds and replaces towels, probably because this is an RCI/interval resort.... not like a regular hotel. There were bbq's for throughout the resort for guests to use and staff were friendly. pool was nice and had a small hut where you could get drinks and snacks. major drawback aside from the pool snackbar, there is NO restaurant on site. Need to drive into town or to Horseshoe resort next door for that.  Overall... for what we paid -- what we got was amazing. Would DEFINITELY go back.

Check was quick, and the staff were super friendly and ready to assist you.  The 1 bedroom unit at the Hansom Area is clean, spacious, and was very comfortable. The kids enjoyed the time we spent in the pool area everyday. While they enjoy the pool, I definitely enjoyed the indoor and outdoor hot tubs. My little 3 year old had a blast in the indoor kiddie pool, and my 9 year old swam in and out of the pool going outdoor and indoor because the pool connects the indoor to the outside. After swimming we would spend time in the playground or go for a walk around the property. The property itself is pristinely kept and is connected to a golf course.   The bed was super comfy and I had the best sleep ever.  We had everything we needed inside the unit itself. We had a full kitchen and it's fully supplied with everything we needed. From plates, cups, glasses, flatwares, cookware, bakeware, they had it for us. All we brought was our food, drinks and condiments. They provided us with the dish washing soap, laundry detergent, hand and dish cloths. The bathroom is also well supplied with toiletries.  The only problem we had was the tv in our living room. We had to reset the breaker every time we wanted to turn it on. Plus, the arcade room could use a bit more interesting games and some of the machines weren't working and just took our tokens.  Other than that, it was a relaxing time with the family, and it's just 1.5h from where we live. We would definitely go back.

The suite is basically a condo, has full kitchen with everything you require if you wish to prepare your own meals, even gas bbq outside if you prefer. There is large living room, balcony, large master bedroom with kingsize bed, large jacuzzi tub and glass double walkin shower. For $149 a night on Expedia, this is a bargain. It is 5 minutes off the 400 or Hwy 11, only minute from Barrie or Orillia. I would say it is the best kept secret north of Toronto.   This last stay, the TV in the living room didn't work and the radio/stereo had no reception. I paid for a late checkout, yet the cleaning staff showed up at 10. Then the desk clerk called and was a bit snarly with me because they had an ""Elite Guest"" checking in that day and needed me out. She then informed me that the night clerk wasn't supposed to offer ""endless mornings"" on Friday. I guess I was a low rent guest....not sure what the difference is???? Anyways, I did stay until 1 as I had paid for it and was in the middle of cooking my breakfast when they arrived.

It made it hard for the kids to get together. However I would go back with just my family. The rooms were very clean and spacious. I started out with a ""bachelor suite"" but was moved to a one bedroom suite, which I recommend if you have children with you. It gives you an extra room for the kids if the adults are staying up later. I did have one incident, but it was quickly resolved in a professional manner. The room next to us ended up being the ""social room"" for another team and the noise level was far beyond reasonable. (about 50 parents and kids gathered in the room) Two suites are joined by a common front door and hallway so we heard every bit of noise coming and going from the other room. I called to see if they could be told to quiet down and the management responded very promptly. However the other room didn't listen and continued to be noisy. I called again to see if we could be moved. We were moved to the one bedroom suite and no extra charge. The management and reservation staff were very professional and sympathetic to our situation.

They were knocking on our daoors and running away, waking up my 3 year old and 10 month old with how loud they were outside running around. They were loud till 1am. After the 3rd time of the kids knocking on our doors and waking up my kids, my husband had to go find the parents. The parents were in a different unit and of course they were appeared to be drunk and not really aware were their kids were nevermind what they were doing.   Ok so besides the hockey teams ruining the last night, it was a great resort. We knew that the time of year we went there wouldn't be much do to (no skiing and the summer stuff closed).  They activities were ok for kids, just wish that the times were different (not nap time).   We will be going back with out kids just for a nice trip away.

148048717,barrie/ca/154980/260333/148048717.html,Carriage Hills Resort,"Carriage Hills Resort about 70 miles northest of Toronto, Ontario doesn't have raging rivers, or huge cliffs or breathless scenery but what it does have is a well organized, remarkably clean resort with all kinds of amenities and staff who go the distance to look after guests. In the Winter there are 4 ski resorts close by, in the Spring trips to the maple bush and in Summer a number of nearby golf courses. Two small cities less than 30 minutes drive away offer shopping and Carriage Hills and the sister resort Carriage Ridge offer all kinds of activities for kids and adults alike.If you're a gambler there is also a large native run casino 40 minutes drive away and it is world class. As for restaurants Carriage Hills has none but Horseshoe Valley Resort - 3 miles away - has a busy pub and a fine dining restaurant. If you prefer to do your own cooking there is a grocery store/liquor/beer outlet 15 minutes and the kitchen facilities in the units at the Hills have everything you'll need to make any meal, complicated or simple. If you're into swimming or exercise the Hills has a beautiful pool - half of which is outdoors and open all year as well as an outdoor hot tub, an indoor hot tub, a wading pool for the kids, a sauna and in the same recreation building an exercise room. While we didn't use the exercise room on our visit but we made full use of the pool (84 deg f ) as well as the fireplace in our room and the jetted bathrub in the large L shaped washroom. Why would you stay at Carriage Hills? You might not fly in from Kansas or California but among the license plates we saw in the parking lot were plates from New York, Ohio, Indiana and Michigan. The resort sits atop a hill in the woods north east of Barrie and the leaves turning in the Fall are beautiful and visitors like us often see wild turkey and fox and the odd deer. For us a visit to Carriage hills meant getting away from the city, congestion, smog and traffic and we can vouch that Carriage hills, in our opinion, is a great place to ""veg out"" AND if you want to veg out just a little they have free wifi on site. While we have been to many places where we were less than thrilled we can't honestly say we found anything negative about Carriage Hills Resort.",4,positive

We stayed in the one bedroom suite that had a full kitchen, separate dining/living area and 1 bedroom with a HUGE bathroom. The place was spotless and the kitchen came complete with everything you would need. We decided to stay in both nights and cook but we were a little disappointed there was no restaurant on site, but wasn't too bad because there are some close by. The town we drove in to took about 15-20 mins and they had a nice shopping area, lots of restaurants and Tim hortons!

When we checked in the room wasn't ready which we found odd because it was suppose to be ready for us 3 days previous. Other then this we enjoyed ourselves. There were mostly snow time activities to do around the resort. We went snowboarding at horseshoe valley (i do not recommend). The resort itself was nice, clean and cozy. I wish the swimming pool was open later (it closes at 10pm). I do not have anything to complain about. There is a grocery store close by, and restaurants. On the resort there are a lot of amenities.

Not worth it for one night because the check-in time is 4PM(it's impossible to get your room before 4PM) and the check-out is 10AM(I assume there is no way to get late check-out). I got there at 11AM because I purchased the full day lift tickets at Horseshoe and hoping for the full fun day of skiing. I've been told to come back at noon. When I got there again at noon, they gave me the room keys but said room isn't ready and asked us to come back at 2 or 3PM. I just took off with my kids and my wife waited in the car which was parked just outside of our room. She doesn't like skiing and being told to activate our keys, if we want to get in before 4PM only if the room is ready. She was hoping to catch the housekeeping service for our room so she can get in as soon as the room is available. She was still waiting for housekeeping service when I returned at 3:40PM. I went back to activate my keys and being told that room isn't still ready again. I was so pissed and just tried our key to our room. Guess what? It opened and our room was ready. It was available since noon but they simply didn't give it to us, instead keep saying your room isn't available. My wife didn't have to stay out in cold so long! TIP: Go there at noon if you need to get there early. They will process paper work after noon and give you the key. Try your key even though they say your room isn't ready. If it opens and room is ready, move in!

It is a resort that is great for the kids, has activities for all age groups in their weekly calendar, and is close to not only ski hills and golf courses but some great little shops and galleries in Craighurst and an 1 1/2 drive to Toronto. I do agree that some of the units decor are dated, but not aweful and certainly not dirty. The company clearly recognizes that the decor is effecting guest experience and have done some renovations. The freshly updated units are beautiful and very cozy. I am sure if this was going to make or break your visit then you could request it and they would do their very best to accomodate your request. Which brings me to my next point. Excellence in customer service... on our last visit (2 weeks ago) we once again were given exceptional service from not only the front desk staff but the lifeguards as well. They not only provided us with information but they even offered to print a map of directions for us!!! Now that is good customer service.   The only thing missing from this place is my Keurig!

I have stayed in studios, one and two bedroom units depending on how many people I was travelling with.  As others have stated there is no restaurant on site, but a quick drive to Horseshoe will give you access to restaurants. The reception area/check-in has always been prompt, questions have always been answered, and lots of information provided. Carriage Hills is divided into three sections, phase one, two and three. Phase one is located closest to the indoor/outdoor pool and activity building. The one bedroom units all have views of forest/hills etc. whereas the studio (hotel room) units face the parking lot. A two bedroom units simply give you access to the studio and the one bedroom combined.  Closeby activites include an awesome pet store, chip truck, grocery store, lcbo and quaint shops in nearby Craighurst. Venturing a little further you can go to restaurants, large shopping malls etc. in Barrie. A little further (about 45 min) and you can visit Wasaga Beach.  Our last trip was a weeklong vacation, thereby allowing us time to enjoy several of the on-site activities the resort offers as well as day trips.  I am planning another vacation for this upcoming summer (August) and am really looking forward to enjoying the pool as well as the adults only hot tub (from 9-10 pm) each evening.

The large jacuzzi was terrific as was the walk in (with 3 of your friends) shower!!! There was a single toilet, though. Everything worked fine. The indoor/outdoor pool was terrific. It snowed in mid April when I went and so it was nice doing laps in the outdoor part of the pool with usually no one there with me. The inside part had quite a few kids. There is an adult swim at 9-10 pm each night I believe. There was also a small gym and a pretty cool games room for the kids. Scheduled daily activities were set out on a weekly plan which was provided in the activity centre. It was wonderfully peace and quiet when I went. It was a 5 minute drive to a Foodland grocery store. The in-house masseuse was out of commission for a month (surgery) when I went bit there are others available within 5 minutes or you can drive to Barrie or Orillia, both about 20 minutes drives away. In the past, I cross country skied here and loved it. I have never downhill skied here though, but it is built up much more than my last trip here a couple of decades ago! (I don't live in the area anymore.) The staff were probably the most friendly and helpful I have encountered in a long time. All in all, a nice peaceful vacation. I can imagine that this is great in the winter if you want to ski, but I would think the summer would be a lot quieter, although Bass Lake (provincial park) is about 15 minutes away if you want to swim there. I believe it is about a 90 minute drive to Algonquin park and probably the same to Toronto. Oh and I had some problems with the HVAC (heater)/fan bit didn't report it until I left.

Located in a upscale neighbourhood surrounded by the Highland Golf Course, you can walk to the Club House. Lots of walking-biking & trails on a beautiful treed ravine, close to Elmvale,Tiny, Midland, Penetanguishene, Barrie, etc. Tree-top adventures with zip-lining is within walking distance, several other golf courses nearby.  The little town of Craighurst is just a few minutes away with a Foodland grocery store and adjacent Beer Store & LCBO, a couple of restaurants, several gift shops, a chocolate specialty shop.  Our stay. The Good: We did get the requested main floor one-bedroom unit in a renovated building - the Clarence. Very nice & comfy unit 2058. Very comfortable master bedroom with king bed and black-out drapes, bathroom has large jacuzzi tub & double sinks with doorway into 2nd part of bathroom with toilet, large glassed-in shower and another sink with entrance off kitchen-living area. Well equipped kitchen with granite counters. Covered verandah with 2 Muskoka chairs overlooking ravine. It was off-season and very quiet, great for R & R.  Not so Good. We were not aware that their indoor-outdoor pool and hot tub would be closed all week for annual maintenance. Then the club-house was totally closed for several days for sealing of floors so no access to fitness centre, games area. Guests had to drive over to the sister property - The Ridge to use their facilities. I've never seen such awful pool towels - ratty thin scratchy hand-towel size. The TV in our unit had terrible reception and maintenance were unable to fix it - frustrating for my husband who wanted to watch the Toronto Maple Leafs. Half-way through our stay, someone moved into the unit above us and stomped around like an elephant in the middle of the night. If my husband wasn't experiencing knee problems we definitely would take the 2nd level next time. Did not like the fact that the temperature control in the small studio side seems to control how hot or cold it gets. Our unit kept getting hotter & hotter no matter how low we turned it. Called maintenance and they had to go into the studio to turn down the thermostat in there. We also had them turn off the pilot light in the gas fireplace.  Things to Note: The Clarence, Hansom & Landau Buildings have two levels. The Stratford, Victoria, Rockaway, Concord & Norfolk have 2 levels at the end of each building and 3 levels in the main part. There are no elevators and walk-up to 3rd level looks steep. The Clarence is one of the original buildings that has been recently renovated. Reception and check-in is located at this building, it's close to the pool & clubhouse.   The condo-style accommodation consists of 2-bedroom lock-outs which means that the 2-bedroom can be separated into 2 individual private units with separate entrances. You enter through a main outside door into a small hallway. Then there are 2 doors, one leading to the smaller studio unit with a verandah facing the parking lot. The other door leads to the much larger one-bedroom unit with verandah facing the forest & ravine or green space depending on which building you are in.  Despite some glitches in our stay, we enjoyed our time and would consider coming back to the Carriage Hills Resort.  Big News! While we were there we found out that Wyndham International has purchased all the Shell Vacation Resorts! Personally I think this is good news. We have exchanged into Wyndham Resorts and they usually are excellent upscale properties - the pool towels will definitely improve with the new management!

The facilities are all you need. It is close to everything and very pleasant surroundings. The only hangup was that the parking facility is very poorly layed out. The spots are too small and you can tend to bang your door into the next car. There are car parking spots in fron of the walkways making it difficult to get out.

There was also a washing machine and dryer that worked perfectly. The bed was very comfortable. A nice surprise was that the wifi was included in the room fee so, it was provided at no additional cost.  The customer service was top notch. The check in service was very pleasant, the check out was as simple as sending a text or making a call. We were surprised to receive a phone call soon after we arrived in our room to make sure we were happy with everything and were also provided with any additional information we needed in regards to the activities provided to us and what's available in the vicinity.

Although still a nice property the maintenance could use a boost; appliances are older and not functioning well. They have started changing the TVs but now have smaller ones than before. Kitchens and Bathrooms should be professionally cleaned/re-grouted etc as mold smell and residue starting to accumulate.  When you check in ask for a newer unit the ones we stay in are the older ones as they have bigger rooms and the configuration makes it easier for 6~8 people in a 2 bedroom unit.

First of all I did not think it should be called a Resort because that intimates that everything one could ever wish to do or need is close at hand. The only grocery store and a few restaurants were 10 - 15 minutes drive . The meals served were varied, good and a lot cheaper than in the city! The distance is not a great inconvenience so not a big negative.  There was a decent sized swimming pool indoor/outdoor on site but from early morning to 9:00pm very busy with lots of kids and families. Adult only swim 9:00pm to 10:00pm but by then we had eaten dinner and too late really to want to swim and then shower again etc.! There was an activity schedule but we did not participate as it seemed mostly for families and we were a couple.  Our apartment ( really nice with hot tub ) backed on to the Highlands Golf Club so we could eat breakfast watching the red squirrels and chipmunks plus the early golfers. Really nice. On the negative side the air conditioner was noisy and situated on the deck outside the bedroom so kept waking me up. The Resort advertises free wifi and for the first few days email was available, albeit intermittent, but the last three days it was totally unavailable . Disturbing as this is when at home the big flod and storm and power outages were going on so it was hard to find out what was happening at home.  Lots of golf clubs close by with very reasonable rates. Discounts for VIP's and guests. Highland Golf Club really a good course. Challenging, well laid out and extremely well kept.  I went for the walking and there are lots of small trails near by and within a short drive in any direction there are various trails providing many different terrains. ie: open lakeside walks, forest walks, hilly walks etc. Some trails follow the ski trails. Ziplining from top to bottom of these ski trails is a fun activity.  The small town of Orillia is about 25 minute drive with some long trails and a nice walk along the lakeside. Also boasts the Mariposa Bakery whose produce no words can amply describe and well worth a visit.  All in all a good week .  Gloria Smith

It was much more modern (especially the kitchen) compared to the room we stayed in last year. We booked a 2-bedroom suite for a week and invited my inlaws to join us and the 7 of us had an amazing time. We went in late May/early June so there was super low occupancy. The pool was generally empty. We got the RMT to come a few times. And other than a bunch of kids that came for a soccer tournament over the weekend, it was very quiet the rest of the time.   Normally when we are on vacation, it's always ""go go go"". But when you are in a location with not much to do, it allows you to relax and spend quality time with one another.

We were really pleased to find that the front door led into both units and by leaving the second interior doors open we had a two-bedroom that the kids could go back and forth between.  The units were both clean and well appointed. The pullouts would not have been comfortable for an adult but were fine for the kids. The location was great for day trips and hiking and there was enough on-site to keep the kids amused.   A few minor hiccups that have been identified in other reviews did not detract from our stay but keep me from giving the resort an ""excellent"" rating.   Hiking advice - if you choose to hike on trails near the resort make sure you have a GPS or other tracker with you.

We were told the room should be available before the 4 PM normal check-in. Our keys were set to unlock the door at 4 PM. We were told to stop by prior to 4 PM for status. Others were getting into rooms, but not us. We entered our room at 4 PM and it had not been touched. We called requesting service, and had to call again. Maids came at 4:20 PM and we were in at 4:45 PM.  Although the room was swept and bathroom cleaned, little effort has been made on deep cleanings. We placed a sheet over the filthy sofa. The carpet didn't look any better. Shelves were dirty. And the balcony had not been touched for months.   The balcony had a nice view, and two chairs and a table. Both the chairs and table were too unstable to use.   Our smoke alarm chirped several times between 3 and 4 AM on our fourth night. Maintenance was called, and we were told it was due to a loose wire. The next night it again chirped between 12:30 and 2 AM.   We brought our bikes and asked the front desk for nearby trails for other than mountain bikes. Personnel were not aware of any. But we found a great trail between Barrie and Orillia that spans over 20 miles. Knowledge of restaurants at the front desk was negligible.  WiFi was a bit slower than dial-up. I ran a speed test, and it came in at .04 mg. Very difficult to use except for very early AM when others were sleeping.  On the bright side, Personnel were friendly. The area is pretty and the views are wonderful. The efficiency itself was larger than other timeshares we have visited and provided ample room for two.

Disappointed that the BBQ/drink area that was at the Hills poolside was not there this year. Was told that the resort was full at check-in. Staff members very nice for the most part. One night during adult only swim time there were still children in the pool 20 minutes after adult only swim time had begun. On that particular evening the lifeguard appeared rather snarly and did not seem happy to be there. The next evening (Sunday night) completely different. No kids in the pool right at 9pm and the lifeguard was very chatty and pleasant to the guests. While at the resort we spent a day at Wasaga Beach, day at Horseshoe Adventure park as well as visiting the pottery shop and souvie shop in Craighurst.   We stayed in a Phase 2 studio this time and saw some wear and tear. The pull out mattress was very saggy and not equipped whatsoever for two teens. Also noticed that the washroom was not very clean at check-in. Shower handle came off in my hand when tried to use it. We had an issue with a fuse blowing several times when we used the microwave.

Even after the 4 pm check-in time our allocated keys would not open our unit ,so I found myself sitting on the steps outside for some considerable time with all the bags and the groceries unloaded from our car while my husband returned to check -in to see what was going on . A kind gentleman from the resort staff saw a lady in distress and came opened the doors and went to fetch my hubby from the line,saying we could see about the keys later.They came on and started working a little later ,perhaps the desk had not found the time to activate them. Not an auspicious start to the week,but once inside we found the unit to be more than fine ,although the kitchen floor still wet ,the cleaners seemed to be behind and very busy. We had a refurbished one bed on the upper level facing the golf course ,as I had phoned and requested and it was very acceptable,with the jacuzzi bath and separate shower room ,we were spoiled for space as a couple .Everything was working and in good order, new carpets and a great bed.The only issue we had was with the TV remotes and maintenance came promptly both times we had this problem and got us up and running. The ladies at the Carriage House information desk were very attentive and helpful with maps and local info and I would suggest visiting them before venturing very far as we got a bit turned around in Orillia,as the roads merge,and a map would have saved the hassle. We did the Big Zip at Horseshoe Valley,went a trail ride ,a Hummer tour with Mike and took the paddle steamer out of Barrie for a Lake Tour .Hubby played a round at the Highlands golf course and was warmly welcomed.We drove up to Wasaga Beach ,Collingwood,and round by the Blue Mountains and we dropped in to the local zoo on route 27 after checking out on our morning of departure.We also had a trip to the malls in Barrie and took in a matinee on the Wednesday, our one dull day,and hit a big thunderstorm on the way back to the resort and couldn't get out of the car for some time! Kinda added to the fun! .So plenty to do and more ,but you do need to travel to it , the country roads are straight and easy. Use the 93 instead of the 400 to get to Barrie,newly resurfaced and much quieter.  The local supermarket in Craighurst is quite expensive,so you may want to use it for topping up,rather than your main shop.It has a Beer Store also.You get resort discounts at some of the local shops/ restaurants and we ate at Settlers Ghost which was nice,at the golf course at Craighurst. We probably will never be back as we're from Scotland ,but thanked them at the resort for a great week.Enjoyed it very much.

We found this resort as an Interval International timeshare exchange. It appears that they also belong to RCI. The resort appeared to be modern and clean. It was comfortable. Special mention goes to Lynne at the clubhouse. She patiently gave us directions to various places we wanted to visit, providing us with maps and brochures as well. Lynne gave us printed instructions for a visit to Toronto which included free parking.  We actually spent little time on the property, preferring to use it as a base of operations for travel around the area. Our unit was an studio unit, but it was large enough for us and quite comfortable. There were several outdoor barbecue grills scattered around the property, and they seemed popular.  As in every timeshare we visit, we disconnected our phone so as to avoid the usual invitations to sales presentations. We relied on our cell phones to stay in touch with family.",5,positive

No one could explain - only that someone had dropped the ball.  Presenting this gift properly was very important to us as it was part of a milestone birthday celebration. Now she was stressed leaving the premises with a bill on a tightly maxed card. I felt very bad especially after telling her not to worry and that her gift had been taken care of well in advance.   The reservations agent even said he'd put notes on the file that it's a special occasion/gift and NOT TO BILL THE GUEST. I was advised that it was not a problem to bill my card for the full amount and that they would only need a credit card from the guest for incidentals. I asked that they call me immediately if there were any issues facilitating this.   This is also why I called to speak with someone in person instead of reserving online. Waste of time.  I understand that due to fraud prevention, credit cards are no longer accepted over the phone (although I encounter many businesses that still do this in emergency or under certain circumstances). But they should have told me they could not facilitate this ahead of time. I could have faxed an authorization. That would take some caring - and a little organization. They could not be bothered.",2,negative

We were somewhat concerned about cleanliness as there was so much dirt piled up under the bed & corners of the room. And the bedding...well, let's just say we were concerned. The exterior looks pleasant but the interior is dated. We were in a bottom unit which had a damp smell and nothing in the bathroom ever dried. We couldn't understand the point of placing the bathroom light switches outside the bathroom -- you wake others if you have to use it in the night. The bed sagged, the old-style hair dryer barely worked and they haven't upgraded to flat-screen TV. Otherwise, it was well equipped. It was definitely sub-par to other RCI resorts we have experienced.   The area is pretty. The resort is set in the middle of a lovely neighbourhood and across the street from a golf course. In summer there is no shortage of golf courses and in winter there are several ski hills in the area. You have to drive to everything (about 1/2 hr to either Barrie, Orillia or Wasaga Beach). The entire vicinity had a ""retirement"" vibe to it. Local restaurants were very good (Silks, Abbott's, the pub at the golf course).

Staff at check-in are snooty and make errors with your reservations.  If you make special room requests, forget it, your requests are not fulfilled.  When you complain, they don't care, have no compassion and are just plain rude and defensive.    The resort and guest rooms look good at first glance, nice furnishings, comfy beds, reasonably clean, good facilities/amenities throughout the resort.  Grounds are well maintained for the most part.    There is a fair amount of wear and tear inside the rooms.  Carpets are stained and sheers have food splatters on them or cigarette burn holes as we experienced and we don't even smoke and I thought the rooms were non-smoking?  Apparently not as they supply guests with ash trays.  Bathroom floor tiles are cracked.  The walls have greasy finger prints on them from previous guests and they don't wipe off.   Had a problem with the window coming off the track so you couldn't close it ... just great in the rain in the middle of the night.  The furniture in the rooms is looking dated and has been abused from former guests and in need of repair.  Such a shame because it is nice, heavy, quality furniture.    The balcony and outdoor deck areas surrounding the rooms are not well maintained.  The paint is peeling and unsightly and there are bird droppings everywhere.  The roof tiles are turning black with mold or mildew or something unsightly.  The paint on the front doors is peeling as well.  The wifi service is irregular, it comes and goes, mostly goes but it's better in the middle of the night which is great if you're a night owl.  The TV reception conks out in rainy/stormy weather, just when you need it the most.  The rooms on the ground level are noisy.  You hear the guests in the room above, kids running and jumping, heavy walkers and the sound of furniture being moved and you can hear the sound of the jets in the jacuzzi bathtub in the unit above as well.  If you book a small studio unit you can hear voices, music and the TV and smell everything that is coming from the larger unit beside you so just pray they aren't cooking something stinky like we experienced at 10:30 at night and with the common entrance way you gotta love these people that come and go in the middle of the night and wake you up.  Sales people here are selling vacation points at this resort and are high pressure, when you say you're not interested or you can't afford it they keep hounding you and will do anything to sell including dropping the price drastically.  On a positive note, we found the housekeeping staff absolutely wonderful, helpful, attentive, friendly and accommodating.  They do a super job with the tools they have to use and fulfill any request you have within reason.  The front desk staff could learn a lot from these young ladies that's for sure.",3,negative

We went to the Foodland supermarket which was 8 mins away and bought corn, veggies and Steaks for dinner which we barbecued on the gas grill close to our unit. This made our stay nicer for we could use the bbq and have some home cooked meals instead of eating dinner out for 7 days straight. We had lunch at the Brewery Bay restaurant in Orillia which is an 18 minutes drive away. For beer chicken, wings, fish/chips, pulled pork, sweet potato fries, it cost $88 for five of us.  We also went fishing at Coochichinga Park off the docks. Casino Rama is about a 32 km drive. Carriage hills is nestled in a huge greenery area, great for golf lovers. We saw a mass of cornfields.

Having read some of the reviews written by people who were unhappy, I was a bit apprehensive about what we would find. It was quite a welcome surprise! Yes, some people may feel that the rooms need updating - that's a personal preference which quite frankly is trivial. We rented 2 suites - one with a full kitchen, the other with a kitchenette - which were clean, spacious & very well appointed. The staff was extremely helpful both during check in & check out & if you're looking for rest, relaxation and golf, this is the place to be. A couple of suggestions for your stay - there aren't a lot of restaurants in the vicinity (and none on the grounds), so unless you're willing to drive out of the resort for all your meals, it would be advisable to bring your food. The same goes for any of the attractions other than Horseshoe Valley Resort which is a couple of minutes down the road - be prepared to drive everywhere.

Downhill and cross country skiing are basically at the door as is golf. Great mountain biking with both single and double tracks can be experienced right from the door if riders are somewhat experienced, in reasonable good physical shape and prepared to ride back up some steep hills. Unfortunately maps of the trails are lacking and this needs to be addressed. Road biking throughout the rolling hills of Oro Medonta is some of the best in Ontario as OroMedonta will soon be the first municipality to have every concession road paved. Hiking trails abound. There are a number of other activities within walking distance from the resort such as dog sledding, tree top adventures, miniature golf, zip line and downhill biking.  The cities of Orillia and Barrie are within twenty minute drive with good shopping, great restaurants and beautiful lake shore walks and parks. Toronto, Canada's largest city is within an hours drive to the south. The scenery with its rolling hills, good vistas, mixed forests and nearby lakes is some of the best in the province.   All in all, it is a very good destination.

However, there seemed to be a few breakdowns in communication when it came to staff-to-staff. Our bed was changed and new towels delivered on the day they were supposed to be. The info book said the bathroom would be cleaned and floors vacuumed. That did not happen so we called. Next day floor was vacuumed but bathroom still not cleaned. Since we are two fairly neat adults that wasn't a major issue but a bit of an annoyance.  Grounds, pool and facilities were kept up well.   We had a good time and enjoyed the resort and the area. Just the communication glitch that needs to be worked on.

Rooms have no noise control with adjoining units. Fine if the people next door go to sleep before you and stay asleep. Not so good if you had young people like we had next door. Coming and going while having some fun.   The resort staff speaks a good line but offer little help. They will not help unless you are about to kick in the door to get into your room. Barbecues that were available across the way were not lit. take a flash light if you don't cook by feel.   Do not expect checkin before 4PM it will not happen. Expect a bill if you want late checkout. Don't expect they will ask how your stay was on checkout. They do not need to here what may be said.   Don't be surprised if the appearance does not come through with clean room and good maintenance.   Good place for a one night stand. Good bed and linen.

We stayed 2 nights the first night we were in the bridal suite and the second night in our own rooms. Their check in time is at 4:00pm we asked for a early check in as we wouldnt be able to check in at 4 cause we will be at the wedding. They didnt have any of our rooms ready prior to this ( we left at 4 to head to the wedding even!) As well a couple that had a reservation they messed up and didnt have their room at all. They were rude when you were explaining the situation to them. Im not one to complain about a place either, I just think if your running a resort you should have staff that dont talk back to the customers. Dont get me wrong the rooms were beautiful!

The bathrooms were large. The rooms were comfortable and updated (we had one of the updated suites.) King Bed was super comfortable. Kitchen area was nice. We enjoyed the patio balcony areas and the views - the leaves were just turning color as we were there end September/early October.  Parking was close by the rooms - we were on the 2nd floor and that was just fine with us.   We were very happy with the resort - and it is a god time share (we have enjoyed properties closer to our home such as Marriott South Lake Tahoe) and in comparison Carriage hills is an equivalent stellar prioperty.  Since we had not visited this area before,we did find ourselves mostly out and about during the day to the parks (Algonquin (yes a long day trip), Wasaga beach, 30,0000 islands, and more. We enjoyed nearby Barrie and going to an ice hockey game. We enjoyed going to the nearby Indian Casino - Casino Rama. After our outings, we always enjoyed coming back to Carriage Hills. It was so nice to end our day at the condo....  Groceries, gas, etc. are a short drive away. All in all a very pleasant place to stay for a week and lots of fun things to do.....too bad we did not have more time to play golf as lots of great courses nearby.

There are no restaurants on the property and the ones within a few minutes were very small and too crowded for our liking. We had to drive to Barrie about 10 minutes away to eat.  The worst part was the noise. We were on the top floor in a studio and the noise from the neighbours is too loud for a nice quiet romantic stay.,2,negative
183918681,barrie/ca/154980/260333/183918681.html,Carriage Hills Resort,"My husband and I stayed at Carriage Hills Resort for one week in mid-September with a time share exchange. We have been time-share exchanging for over 25 years now and this exchange experience is one of our best over-all experiences. We arrived at the resort around 5:00 which is after the check in time of 4:00 and our unit was ready for check in. I had researched a little before our trip about the resort and knew that the buildings were either two or three stories tall with no elevators. About a week before our check in date I called the resort to request a ground floor unit. Our assigned unit was indeed ground floor and even an end unit (you have one extra window for more sun light). I had also requested an updated unit but was told at check in this was not possible. After seeing our assigned unit, it truly did not matter to me if we had an upgraded unit or not. Their was nothing unacceptable about our one bedroom lovely unit. Lots and lots of space for two people and the bathroom arrangement was where two people could be using the different areas with privacy. The jetted bathtub and separate shower are a great idea and having three bathroom sinks was very easy to get used to. We had a central foyer and two separate doors to enter your own unit. The unit next to us was a studio which was only occupied part of the week that we were there. Our units furniture was very comfortable and the gas log fireplace was used for cosmetic reasons several times. I did not cook any meals in the well furnished kitchen but it did appear to have everything you might need if you were to want to cook. In our joint foyer was an additional door that led to a laundry room that is used just for these two units. Very handy and much more cost effective than having a washer and dryer in every unit. Housekeeping was excellent and the unit was very very clean when we arrived. Housekeeping did change our sheets and replenish our towels mid week and even tidied up some. When we first arrived I could not believe how many fresh sets of towels were in the unit. Lots and lots of them.  We did not use any of the resorts facilities but I did look to see what the two pools looked like and they both were very nice. The grounds of the resort was very lovely and well maintained. Our check out was done the evening before our departure and again was handled well and politely. We needed to drive into Toronto on four separate days and each evening when we returned to the resort we were happy to be coming home to such lovely accommodations. One whole day we went sight-seeing north around the Midland area and really enjoyed the scenery and the attractions. The area around Carriage Hills Resort is open farm land with some golf courses and very quiet and scenic.   We hope to return for another visit.
 
 
 Room Tip:  If you need/want a ground floor unit just ask. I'm sure if they can they will assist you.

The 1 bedroom condo was spacious and the kitchen was very well equipped, allowing us to cook a wonderful Christmas dinner. The bed was comfortable, the bathroom space great and the jetted tub very nice addition. Check in was easy, and friendly. The pool and the arcade were a big hit with our grandchildren who spent a night over with us. The grounds are nice to walk around, but weather for us limited that. We ate at Theos in Orillia about 20 mins away it was great, we grocery shopped in Barrie also 20 mins drive they have everything there, even Costco a great place to shop and get cheap gas, if you are a member of course. We would rerecommend this resort to friends and family. Would definately come again ourselves.

We have travelled extensively with RCI for over 25 years so we have seen the good, the bad and the ugly!  Ok. The resort itself is large, beautifully designed and well maintained with a easy and cheerful check in and check out but that's where the wow factor stopped!   Both apartments were large but I have to agree with other reviewers that there's a very musty odour in the hallway and apartment. To be honest the apartments are in desperate need of a revamp as decor, furnishings and all contents are well passed their sell by date. Putting that aside everything was very clean and there were plenty if clean towels etc.  The outdoor BBQ stations are great and there's plenty of them around the resort so it was fun but I can't say using the pool was fun. We chose this resort as it had an indoor heated pool for our granddaughter but boy it was freezing. After our first taste of the cold water we were told it would be warmer the next day but our second swim was the last - if this is Carriage Hills idea of a heated pool please visit other resorts - my granddaughter actually came out blue, not good.  As for the area, well other reviewers have covered that in detail and yes there's stacks to do.  So, I guess I am struggling to say much else about Carriage Hills. Yes on the face of it it's a beautiful resort but getting down to the nitty gritty,there's a lot that doesn't make the mark and unless there was major renovations and the pool issue addressed then it doesn't get my vote.

18645024,barrie/ca/154980/260333/18645024.html,Carriage Hills Resort,"Took my 6 year old and 4 year old for a 3-night stay in the one-bedroom condo. We had booked the Carriage Ridge, but due to renovations, were put in the Hills instead. Basically the same thing with room lay-out. The rooms and the grounds were spotless, with even my 6 year old asking why there was no garbage on the ground outside. Room was very spacious and comfortable and pretty quiet. My only complaint was the pool. The Ridge has only an indoor pool, so weather is not an issue. The Hills has indoor/outdoor, but the are NOT separate pools, simply plastic tags hanging between them (they didn't tell me that when they moved us to the Hills). Therefore when it rains, they close all the pools. There were ALOT of older kids in the pool, as well as adults, and they play rough. Balls are thrown around very hard, without regard for anyone else in the pool, as well as diving and jumping right over your head and alot of pushing and shoving. My two do not swim well, so we basically had to limit our pool time to a very small corner where I had to shield them from flying bodies and balls. There are life guards on duty, but they do not do anything to curb the rough play (where are these kids's parents?). Other than that, we enjoyed the stay and would come back (although I would try the Ridge next time).",4,positive

We were extremely excited to go and enjoy the resort amenities. We arrived at 1pm and proceeded to check in. Upon checking in we were told that check in time is not until 4pm and check out time was at 10am. We asked if we could check in early if our room was ready. We were told our room was not ready and to check back later. We didn't make a big deal seeing that the check in time was stated as 4pm.  We proceeded to go for lunch and try our best to use the facilities until our room was ready. After lunch we called the front desk only to be told that since it was 230 our room still wasn't ready. We decided to sit in the car outside of our room and wait. We could not believe that between 230 and 420 when our key finally let us in that nothing happened to our room.   This was only the tip of the iceberg. Upon checking in we asked if we could have a late check out after 10am. We were quickly told yes no problem, for a fee of $35+tax which would allow us to check out at 1pm. Apprehensive we decided to pay the $35. We woke up at 930am to a phone call asking if we were still coming to their timeshare presentation, something we said the night before we did not want to attend. After that we went out for a wonderful breakfast at a local diner called Loobies. After a terrific and affordable breakfast we came back to the resort only to find out that our room keys were deactivated and the conversation and $35 fee we paid the day before giving us a late check out fell on deaf ears. Now locked out of our room we had no choice but to call the front desk and wait in our car in -20 temperature until someone came and let us back into our room.   Please note that the reason my girlfriend and I felt the need to write this negative review about Carriage Hills was how they gave us our exit interview. When we dropped off our resort keys at the front desk the lady assisting us proceeded to ask me how our stay was. I looked up and simply responded to her question with ""it was so-so"" she looked up from her computer and said ""oh okay"". That to us showed a lack of desire to improve or correct any issues we as guests encountered.",2,negative

I was accommodated regardless of my change of plans, and extra time at the resort.  If you are looking for a to have your room made up each day, this is not going to happen. I believe you would get light cleaning and standard cleaning in a week, twice only. Yet I am certain they would accommodate your specific needs.  However the hotel has everything you will need to keep everything in order. Washer/dryer, vacuum, all the possible cooking pots, pans, dishes... what you don't have you can get through the guest/member building. I was interested in having a group over and it was not a problem finding a caterer with the help of staff at Carriage Hills.  What can I say. Really great staff, inside and outside.

My boyfriend and I decided to come the weekend before valentines day for a vacation. We didn't want to use his mothers time so we paied the full price, which was nearly 400 dollars. The firs night we arrived we used the outdoor hot tub. As I was getting out the pathway was EXTREAMLY icy and I fell and bruised the side of my leg, my shin, and had 2 gashes on my feet that were pretty deep. When my boyfriend helped me inside the lifeguard had no first aid kit. All he had was a few band aids. I went back to my room and called the next day to explain more about the incident and the manager Leslie for that department couldn't have been ruder. She claimed shell resorts has good lawyers and that the incident was my own fault. I didn't even threaten to get lawyers involved, and she was extremely hostile about the whole issue. I was more concerned that other people could get hurt. Since we've been coming here for years I at least expected some hospitality. She offered no reembusement for our stay, even though I was so badly injured I couldn't even leave the hotel room. She did not express any concern at all, and rather acted like I was some kind of criminal trying to rip them off or something. She wouldn't let us speak to a manager above her, we had to spend hours on the phone to get a hold of shell resorts since so no on this resort wanted to help. They all were pressuring me to sign forms saying I wouldn't sue basically, with no regard for others that could get hurt.

The desk staff at the pool building are so helpful they become your best friends for the week by making you feel welcome and giving you suggestions on what to do at the resort and in the area. I had accidently left my watch in one of the lockers one evening and the desk staff had it waiting for me when I came in the next morning to let them know I had lost it.

We have been there before and the experience has always been a good one, so we went back. We had time this visit to spend time at the pool and hot tubs. A great way to relax. We had Susan the RMT treat us to massages in our room after skiing at Mount Ste. Louis for the day. Discounts at Mt. Ste. Louis when you tell them you are staying at Carriage HIlls. This year Horseshoe has decided to give no discounts. Tried snowshoeing for the first time, as it was offered free on the activity schedule, so much fun to try something new. The guides Chantal and Leslie were awesome and made trying this new sport an adventure. Also got to meet other guests. No restaurants on site but with great kitchens in your suite we cooked most of our own meals, but ate at Settler's ghost one night. Again a discount menu if you tell them you are staying at Carriage hills. Definately a great place to visit even if it was a shorter stay this time. Rooms were very nice, well maintained. New pool towels are nice and bigger - you had in a pool card just like when you are down south. lots to do in the area with skiing at Mt. Ste. Louis and snow tubing at Snow Valley. Tried a couple of new activities - a medition/medium class and a couples massage. Nice way to treat yourself after skiing or snowshoeing. Will definately be back to try the summer months with hiking and golf.

194047677,barrie/ca/154980/260333/194047677.html,Carriage Hills Resort,"Rented 2 x 2 bedroom condos for myself, family and friends 2nd week in January. An e-mail to the resort 4 weeks before arrival was good enough to negotiate adjoining condos. Main purpose of holiday was to ski, so with plenty of snow there, we were not disappointed. Nearby Horseshoe Valley Resort (5 minutes drive) is ideal for intermediate skiers but 1 week there lost its challenge for the experienced skiers in our group. Good value ski rentals and lift passes, though. Most of the slopes were open and uncrowded (never had more than 4 people in front of me for the ski lift lines).Try the great snow-tubing hill for something different. The Carriage Hills Resort condos were extremely spacious, well equipped and comfortable. A huge king bed in each of the huge bedrooms and a jacuzzi bath in the master room. Everyone in the family managed to get connected to the free wi-fi except me, but their connectivity was a little intermittent. The only negative about the resort was the half hour wait in the check-in line. We'd only travelled 2 hours from Toronto airport but others had been on the road for several hours more, so the wait in line at resort reception (which was too small to accommodate all arrivals), tested the patience of some. The staff were extremely friendly and helpful. The only two maintenance problems we encountered (a wobbly table and no pilot light on the fire) were dealt with extremely efficiently. We loved the gym (although any more 5 people using it felt overcrowded) and the indoor/outdoor pool and outdoor hot tub, which were a novelty to bathe in when its snowing and -10C! The nearest town of note was Barrie (25 minute drive) or the smaller (and prettier) Orilla - both with big malls for 'retail therapy' shopping and restaurant choice. However, groceries and booze could be bought 10 minutes from the resort at a Foodland store in nearby Craigshurst. We only tried two 'local' restaurants and recommend both: Settlers Ghost Golf Club (small, but with excellent service and delicious, not-too-expensive food), and the Crazy Horse (located in the heart of the Horseshoe Valley ski area and which was ideal for a hearty lunch). I'd love to go back to Carriage Hills Resort but not to ski - to golf! There seemed to be sign posts for golf courses everywhere and the terrain looked ideal. I won't choose January, though.

Tons of space for the 7 of us, about 1200 sq feet I believe. Units were very nice and fairly well stocked.  Check in a bit of a nightmare as a small office with lots of people waiting to check in. No early check in, so everyone there at 4:00. Not a good setup. Pool was very crowded after dinner. Would suggest going earlier. Wi-fi was not good at all and needs to be upgraded.  We would return if the price was right.",4,positive
194542178,barrie/ca/154980/260333/194542178.html,Carriage Hills Resort,"Location: There are two physical locations to Carraige Ridge. There is the Carraige Ridge portion which is closer to Horeshoe and then Carraige Hills which is about a km away.  Check In: In either case, you must go check into the office at the Carraige Hills location at Highland Drive. There is a small parking lot for all guests to wait at. This can be a problem because the check in process is quite slow which leaves guests to try to figure out where to park in order to check in.  Check Out: If all is in order, you can check out by text or phone. It was surprising that guests are forced out at 10AM while they can not check in until 4PM. You can stay until 1PM if you pay more. Amenities: The rooms are part of a three story structure of joined condos in a long, townhouse style. There are only common stairs to each level which can be an issue if you are bringing up heavy items. Since this is not really a hotel or a resort, but more a housekeeping style condo, guests must bring what they need and clean up after themselves because there is no cleaning service. Rooms get one set of towels per person. Guests each get a card to present for a pool towel. Apparently, you must keep the card to return at check out after returning the towel or face charge. Each location has an indoor pool and workout facilities in a separate building. In the winter, dress up because you will have to walk to the pool. Rooms: We had a two bedroom suite which was in fact two adjoining suites, linked with a common entrance (but each room had its own locking door inside past the common entrance). Although a little dated and worn, rooms were very spacious and quiet. The larger suite had a full kitchen, with pots and pans, plates, utensils, glasses, mugs, coffee maker, toaster, kettle, stove top, oven, dishwasher, full size fride, fireplace, jacuzzi, stand up shower, bed, sofa bed, dining table tor six, kitchen island with 2 stools. The living/dining room and kitchen combination was separate from the bedroom and washroom.  The smaller suite did not have a kitchen, but a sofa bed, bed, separate washroom with standup shower, closet, kitchenette with small fridge, microwave, coffee maker, toaster, sink, 4 sets of plates, glasses, utensils.  The common tiled foyer to the two suites had a washer dryer and recycling blue bins (and the water heaters). This area could be used to store things such as ski equipment. Tips: There is no dining facilities or store on the facility so be prepared to bring in all of your supplies or drive out to get some. I noted that on the busy family weekend, every parking spot was taken by late dinner so don't be out too late. There is a Foodland off Horeshoe road for groceries or else go back 20 minutes to Barrie. Winter activities: Horeshoe is very close by car for alpine skiing, cross country or other activities such as snow tubing. Sometimes Horeshoe offers specials so monitor often. I do not think discounts are offered from Carriage Hills. Mt St. Louis Moonstone is about 15 minutes away. If you really want to ski, you are probably better off going to Mt St Louis because Horeshoe is small and their parking is very sparse. Horeshoe does have very good cross country trails though. Overall: Very quiet and relaxing stay. We were not fussed by the housekeeping style. One final mention to John from maintenance who assisted us find our unit.",3,negative

For skiers, snowboarders & snow tubers the hills are right around the corner. Have stayed before in Spring/Summer and the golf courses are great. Recreation staff will go out of their way to be helpful, if need be.  Check-in is somewhat of a hassle as the area is small and if a few people come in all at once then it gets very crowded.

The accommodations were roomy and very comfortable. Though we dis'nt get a chance to ski there was still plenty to do. Ienjoy working out and they have a nice gym with large plate glass windows that over look the indoor/outdoor pool and hot tub. The staff was also very nice and extremely helpful. Would definitely recommend thi resort.,4,positive

The staff under the organizational skills of Lesley Janis, Activities Director, was the most phenominal experience.   The unit was a comfortable 2 bedroom/2 bathroom unit. Beds fantastic, everything you need, full kitchen and washer/dryer. My husband was snow shoeing most days, they run a great program. I attended aqua fit classes, meditation classes, craft classes. The staff was most considerate to drop off a couple of tables so that I could set up my sewing machine. Restaurants were close by, shopping close by, fun to drop into Horseshoe Valley ski hills to watch and enjoy a Beaver Tail. Again we cannot say enough about the staff at Carriage Hills, and we cannot wait to go back.

Check-in took over half an hour standing in a congested small room. The person that greeted us tried to sell us on a time share presentation. Arrived at about 6pm so we wanted to head out for dinner but the safe in the room was locked… I called the front desk...they put me on hold for about 10 minutes...I called back and the person did the same thing...only waited 5 min this time da! had coffee, but no filters in the room so had to call again for coffee filters in the morning…could not wait to get on the hill, so I guess no coffee…next day no coffee …we asked for a late check out because you have to check out by 10 am, but sorry we were told, none available…the place did not seem that busy…our kids always swim before we head out…but this time we were told we could not even use the pool after 10 am… We would normally let them swim for an hour and head out from the pool area…but sorry…new management we were told.  Sometimes new management can improve things but not here…there goes a nice tradition...anybody know of some well run resort in the area? Preferably not a time share.

The amenities are lovely and well kept, but the staff is extraordinatry! We have not met one person who has not gone above and beyond in their service. The staff at Carriage Hills is a team and it clearly shows because they make the time spent there - fun. Our experience has been so good that we have told several other families about Carriage Hills. They too have gone and are absolutely raving about the facilities and staff. Our kids love the pool and recreation facilities at Carriage Hills. We have a pool at home and we like everything around the pool and hot tub to be well maintaiined. I find that staff are if anything extreme on their maintenance and in their attention to safety. This gives us a good feeling and we just enjoy every minute. I would like to recommend this resort as one you do not want to miss out on.

There were seven of us, we had accomondations with two adjoining rooms. None of us had ever been here, but we will all definately return. In fact we enjoyed ourselves so much, we plan to make it a yearly get-together. From the moment we checked in, the hospitality was revealed, the staff go out of their way to welcome you and show all the amenities and activities available for the stay here. Our rooms were far above our expectations, cleanliness, comfort, and attractive decor. The beds were really comfortable, even the fold out couches were great. The kitchen, laundry, and washrooms were sparkling fresh, the jacuzzi bath extraordinary, the fireplace comfortable and heartwarming. Everything we needed was available from utensils to dishsoap, bathing needs, bedding needs, closet space, gracious living space etc. etc. The staff was extraordinary, going above and beyond to make us feel comfortable and satisfied. When we visited the pool building we were excited and amazed at the cleanliness, the awesome inside/outside pool. The hot tubs were equally amazing, and the setting was phenominal. Our stay included a lesson with snowshoes which was an amazing experience. Then we spent $15 to have a bus take us to a farm where we gathered for a two-horse drawn wagon ride into open fields and a wonderful forest. The sound of the sleigh bells were refreshing and relaxing. Afterward we were offered a nice cup of hot chocolate, then back onto bus and home again. Our stay here was a wonderful, warm experience and I would highly recommend this fabulous resort to anyone and everyone!

This is our second time, the first being in the summer of 2003. Had 2 bedroom which is a studio and a 1 bedroom combined. Very happy with unit. Offered privacy for all. Also had full kitchen facilities as part of the 1 bedroom unit, the studio has a mini fridge only. Each unit had a king size bed and a pull out sofa. There is laundry facilities in the foyer of each studio/1 bedroom unit (ie shared between the 2 units) which came in handy.  Was March break so pool was a bit crazy but the last hour (9-10) each day reserved for adults only. Used the gym 3 times during the week, small but never more than 5 in there including wife and I. Was surprised they did not offer ski discounts at Horseshoe Valley resort but was very please to have discovered Mount St Louis as a result as this is where ski discounts were available.   My only complaint would be the lack of dining options near the resort. Options were plentiful if you took the 20 minute trek to Barrie. The kitchen facilities made up for that. Would highly recommend for a family ski trip.",4,positive

The rooms are big and beautifully appointed with everything you could possibly want -- a Jacuzzi in the master bathroom and a fireplace for the cold nights. If you need something ""extra"", like a blender or muffin tin, chances are they have it for borrow. I love the indoor-outdoor pool. Even in the winter, it's nice to swim outside.

Overall, our stay was enjoyable. Staff was super friendly, helpful, attentive. Our one-bedroom unit had a full kitchen, was spacious, and clean, though you track in a lot of sand in the winter months. The bathrooms are also super spacious.  A few things that are not so great: 1) paper-thin walls/floors/ceilings, there were elephants staying above us, we could hear their every move as they stomped all over their room! 2) wifi: though free, is very poor 3) the pool area closes at 10PM - There is nothing better than an evening soak in an outdoor hot tub... but when we arrived just before 10PM on a Friday night, we were disappointed to know we'd missed the window for a hot tub and again on the Saturday, we we had to race back from dinner to ensure we made it back on time to be able to enjoy it. Most resort pools/hot tubs are open until 11PM 4) the living room furniture is not very comfortable - this matters to us night-owls because since the pool area closes so early, it's nice to be able to lay back and watch a movie.  The setting is beautiful. We opened up the windows, and sat out on the back porch with our coffee and the birds were chirping away. A nice escape in the off-season.   We took advantage of the very few amenities/restaurants in the immediate area: 1) Loobie's - great hearty comfort food 2) Settler's Ghost restaurant - good food, nice menu, small, charming, yet brightly-lit dining area, not very romantic.  3) Silk's - buffet breakfast ($14 pp) 4) LCBO - very convenient location to the resort  Other than going into Barrie, there is not much else to do there in the post-ski season. Ski hills are closed, and hiking trails are not yet passable. We'd likely return during the ski-season.",3,negative

Check in took a long time & as our company added an extra day to our initial reservation, we actually had to go back the second day & re-register. Makes no sense why they couldn't deal with this at check in, we didn't even change rooms, silly system I guess.  The internet was too expensive & the whole week we were there it wasn't even working. The frustrating part is that the hotel has nothing to do with the internet, it's an independant american company, so to get any help, you have to call a call centre somewhere in the states.  The rooms are very nice, bed comfortable. I loved the fireplace. It's true that the walls are very thin. You can hear everything around you.  The kitchen was great & had pretty well all the kitchen supplies you would need to cook up a meal. It was also nice to have laundry right outside our door.  As it's in the middle of nowhere, you have to drive to barrie to find some good restaurants. Beware, checkout is early (10am) & they will charge you if you check out late.",3,negative

People need the jobs this establishment offers. I dislike posting negative feedback. So, some context: I've used this venue as a training base (for trail running) for about three years. It has been OK for that. I just train, eat, sleep. However, increasingly, with each visit one receives a very intense sales pitch to but a condo. This last time gave me the experience of what it must be like to have a pit bull on your throat and not letting go. This despite a request to not be contacted during my stay. So aggressive are their tactics that a long line - up formed as a condo sales agent interrupted check in to encourage a couple to participate in a free meal / presentation / showing, while an uncomfortable check in person looked on.   So....lots of young families enjoy this place (can be noisy). It is situated beside a modest and pleasant ski hill. For athletes (runners), the trails surrounding the property are pristine, plentiful and shrouded in nature.   The price point is such that you don't expect top line comforts (beds and linens are passable), but that's OK. A lovely feature is the balcony, which allows for quiet (sort of) and pleasant contemplation.   i sense the management is high pressure (an assumption) to sell, sell, sell and use the lower price point to attract customers so they may sell, sell, sell. It is akin to those old Florida deals where you'd be offered free flights and rooms in exchange for going to a presentation. Except nothing is free, and you still get a relentless pitch.",2,negative

The pool is lovely and we made use of the barbecue areas and the activities  The small supermarket 10 mins away is really good  Our favourite restaurant was Settlers ghost, really good food and great service and prices, also Abbots was the same standard and very nice  We went to crazy horse restaurant but found this overpriced and very average food, we would not recommend that one  We would look forward to staying again at this resort",5,positive

Staff is very friendly and helpful, the rooms are large and have fireplaces and large whirlpool bathtubs. You can use just a small unit though with a partial kitchen -it depends on your needs. It is generally very quiet and the trees offer privacy as well as the impression of being in the forest when you look out your window if in the right unit. We like being on the top floor so we do not hear anyone walking above us - this is the one area the units are a little weak, especially if there are children in the unit above you. There is a golf course across the street and of course, Horseshoe Valley below with their course as well as numerous others close by. The place has a pool that is indoor and outdoor and a nice size hot tub. Games are available as well as DVDs for rent.

We stayed in the 2 bedroom suite that can accomodate up to 8 people. The rooms were clean and nicely decorated; the kitchenette was big enough to allow 3 people to cook at one time; and the living room offered a cozy, comfortable area where we could relax and watch movies. The cost was quite reasonable, we even managed to get a 15% discount for booking in advance.   The recreational area had many facilities including an indoor pool and hot tub (which was well-maintained), billard table, internet access, small fitness center and games & movies to borrow.   The check-in service was excellent. All the staff were friendly and professional. Checking into the resort only took 5 minutes and they were even helpful in providing us with maps of neaby hiking trails. Room service was quick, even at midnight when we requested for extra blankets.   I would highly recommend this resort to everyone. There are many activities nearby including Arbraska tree-top trekking and skiing at Horseshoe Valley. I would definately come back again!",5,positive

The indoor/outdoor pools/hot tubs were great. The staff was helpful. The environs were interesting. The food in Barrie was great. We visited the longest freshwater beach in the world, took a tour of their 30,000 lakes in Georgian Bay, and ate at two excellent raw restaurants, one in Barrie and one in Collingswood. The studio was comfortable inside. Sadly, the tiny 6'x6' deck was in need of repair and, interestingly enough, part of the deck was used by the air conditioner unit which blew hot air across the deck. Not that pleasant, we had to turn the A/C off to use the deck. The free wi-fi was sooooooo sloooooow as to be unusable, but hey, no email is not a bad thing.

Everything on the inside was immaculate when we checked in with all furnishings in great shape.   The only suggestions are that the patio railings are in need of paint as ours (2110) was peeling and since many units have 4 people occupying them, there should be more than 2 patio chairs instead of having to drag two of the dining chairs outside.

The bathroom had two vanities and a separate shower. Adjacent to the bedroom was a large whirlpool tub. The bed was king size and comfortable. The staff at this resort are knowledgeable and offer assistance whenever you need it. There is an indoor outdoor pool which is much better than the pool at Carriage Ridge. There is hot tub and a large seating area outside. The upper floor has a work out area. The property is right beside Horseshoe Resort. You can play golf at their two courses in the summer or use the ski hills in the winter. Settlers Ghost golf course is only a mile away as well. Horseshoe has many activities and you can buy a day card and use all of them. Carriage Hills also has planed activities throughout the week for kids and adults.  You are very close to Orillia from here and can walk along the water front park, get groceries, a good lunch or visit the Stephen Leacock property that is very beautiful. A half hour drive takes you to Wasaga the best beach on all the Great Lakes. A little further down and you will be in Collingwood a quaint little town with nice shops and good places to eat. Blue Mountain is just a bit further. It is full of activities and has a village modeled after the Village in Whistler. Beautiful place to just walk around.  If your from outside Canada or Ontario - the resort has day trips to various areas like Toronto and Niagara. If you plan well this is a great resort to stay at with many different things around you.

The great appeal of this resort is the opportunity it provides guests to make themselves at home.   You are essentially renting an apartment, not a hotel room; and as such; you find yourself with great space to live in.  The units are generally very well taken care of and offer all the amenities you'd expect to find at home. Ownership is consistently upgrading the fixtures in all rooms, in order to keep all units modern and up to date.  The pool is located in the Carriage House, and offers great indoor and outdoor swimming from the same pool.   You'll generally find that the guests are friendly and are happy to engage in conversation about the area, their stay and just about anything in general.  Tips:  - Buy your groceries in Barrie or Orillia. The Foodland on Horseshoe Valley Road is very expensive. - Remember the staples; butter, oil and a BBQ lighter

The rooms were very clean and spacious. A cute little shop is close by with a little something for everyone in the family (my choice was a cute pair of earrings and the boys chose the fudge and icecream). There is a great chocolate factory close by. Horseshoe Adventure Park is very close and the Adventure Park was fantastic. The room rates are very reasonable. My only fault was not familiarizing myself with the grocery store hours or stocking before arriving :( And I am not a big fan of the 'Arcade'. My boys spent 1/2 of their vacation money and most of the machines were faulty...including the prize dispenser. It became the 'nightmare' of our trip. After 4 days of vacationing in Southern Ontario our last night 'arcade' fiasco ruined it for them ?? ENJOY what they have to offer..other than the arcade !! :)

I believe that this was our 11th visit to the Hills/Ridge complex and have stayed in studios, one bedroom and two bedroom units. This time I stayed in a studio since there were just two adults. When considering all the visits we have had at the Hills/Ridge complex I think that this was by far the cleanest unit I have stayed in. The unit was absolutely spotless, no dust bunnies to be found (and I do tend to look). The check-in/out process was seamless as usual. The Hills rec centre staff (Peggy Ann) was delightful and very helpful when we asked about directions to the mall in Barrie. The pool, change rooms, sauna and both indoor and outdoor hot tub were also very clean. I really enjoyed the adult only swim from 9 to 10 pm nightly. If you have any specific questions, please do not hesitate to message me since I have stayed so many times, I feel very familiar with all aspects of the resort.

We did have a couple of suggestions for travelers there:  We came on a Friday night, after leaving work, and showed up at 10:15. The front desk staff were very friendly and nice and check in went quick and smoothly. When we got to our room we were pleasantly surprised with the anemities i.e. kitchen has full dish collection including any utensils you would require, automatic ice machines, dishwasher, etc. We stayed in a two bedroom suite.   Tip: if you intend on getting in after 10 pm, stop in Barrie for snacks, drinks, food, etc. because it is the closest place for you to find these items at 30 minutes away! There are vending machines on the premises, however they are locked away inthe pool complex which is also closed at 10 pm. Our issue with this is that the pool complex is a separate building that is accessed by key card and under surveillance, so why does it have to be ""closed"" at all? There are no rooms in this building so noise would not be the issue.  The other problem we encountered with this ""resort"" is that you are basically instructed to complete your own cleaning upon leaving including lugging a bag full of heavy linens to the parking lot as well as your own garbage removal and dish cleaning, granted ther is a dishwasher. The issue we had is that if this place is truly advertising itself as hotel accomodations and not a time share ( and prices are conducive with hotel prices in the area) then these services should be included.  We stayed for two days and the rooms and resort is very pleasant, accessible, and there are many resort signs directing you to the correct location of your building/room accomodations.",4,positive

We love the space, quiet, comfy beds and sofa beds, blackout blinds (the kids can play hide and seek with flashlights during the day), and full apartment with washer/dryer etc.  It is like home but uncluttered by stuff.  Even though we come in the off season the mini activities they offer keep the family busy and happy.   We love, love, love, the indoor/outdoor pool, and jacuzzi in our room and especially the fact that they lend games and puzzles! Resort management: Don't ever stop offering those things.  These are main reasons why we travel so far.  We have never had unhappy staff. Everyone is always eager and ready to please.  The worst thing that happened was that the front desk took a while (15 min) to get us our room and the kids were getting antsy in the car.  In their defence we forgot our confirmation number at home.  Definitely will be back . . . Again!  A few tips: You can't play in the Carriage Hills indoor/outdoor pool if you stay at the Ridge so make sure you book at the right one.

We had booked 1 week at this resort, Carriage Hills from dec 27 to Jan 3. We made the booking in Dec 2013, well over a year in advance. Yesterday we got a call from the resort saying that something ""has happened to our room"" and we cannot have it . In place of our 2 bedroom with full kitchen and 2 bathrooms they are going to put us up at the Best Western. The best western is just a regular hotel room with no kitchen. So that means we would be cramped in one small room and would have to eat out. How can this be a fair substitution. I am to assume that the Best Western hotel is the same caliber as Wyndham resorts and that all the people that are buying timeshare at this place are really just wasting their money since the Best Western is just as good. The bottom line is that resort was over booked and our room was given away to someone else that has some inside connections. Extremely disappointed with the complete lack of customer service. I am truly sorry that my family has timeshare with Shell vacation club. I will not recommend anyone to buy timeshare with this company as it does not valves its members and leaves them out to dry during the holiday season.  A Mavadia",1,negative

Semi-private laundry facilities (shared with the adjacent 2BR unit) was a bonus. Very close to Horshoe Resort and Barrie. The pool was big enough but the games room was tiny.

They also took my mobile number and said they would call if the room was ready early. At 4:00 we went to the room and the keys didn't work, the cleaning people were still in the room and they came out and VERY rudely told us that the room would not be ready for another 30 minutes. Now I get it that the housekeeping staff on a turnover day at a resort is likely stretched thin and under pressure to get things done but this place is not so good they can treat people like garbage and we will keep coming back. We went to the front desk to find out what was going on. After waiting in line for about 20 more minutes the desk lady called housekeeping and we were told the room would be at least another 30 minutes. That would have our room ready at 5:00. Checkin is 4:00. This is a problem to me. I asked if they could move us to another room instead and was told that would be no problem. This raises the question, why didn't they just offer me that room at 1:00 when I showed up the first time??? Finally at our room, I was pleasantly surprised. The room was very nice. A good size kitchen area, a table big enough for 5-6 people a large sitting area and big bathroom and bedroom with king bed. (we were in a 1 bedroom suite with kitchen). The Tv's are from the 90's, big old tube TV's with one small one in the bedroom and one large one in the living area which badly need to be replaced. We were given one towel card per person for towels at the pool (which is in a different building you have to walk or drive to depending on the weather). When we went swimming we found out that this meant we received one towel each for the duration of our stay. You actually have to wash the towels yourself in the laundry room just outside your unit. They won't exchange it for you through your stay. This is crazy. If you want me to wash my own towels at least provide me 2 towels per person as we went swimming a few times per day and ended up with wet towels by the second swim of the day. Not cool. This resort advertises itself as ski in/ski out. It most definitely is not. The sister resort down the street carriage ridge has some units that are ski in/ski out but none at carriage hills. You have to drive to the ski hill which is about 5 minutes away.

This resort advertises itself as family friendly and yet they do very little to ensure that your family has a good stay. On both Friday and Saturday night we filed noise complaints against our neighbours at 10pm. We were told that they couldn't do anything until 11pm. They seem to think that 11pm is an appropriate time for children to be able to fall asleep. Saturday night was far worse we phoned repeatedly from 10pm to midnight as the music was louder and louder, we could sing along if we had wanted. Our ""neighbours "" were shouting, slamming doors, and smoking. Apparently a security guard went to investigate and knocked on the door if an elderly gentleman who was watching tv and she thought she had solved the problem. After we called back, she was sent to investigate further and she ended up using her key to walk  right into the entrance way of our unit and she started  knocking on our doors to ask us Which unit was making the noise. This scared our daughter  Because strangers can just walk into our unit in the middle of the  Night. It was about 12:45/1am at this point. The cleanliness and size of the rooms do not make it a family friendly resort, being able to relax and get a good nights sleep is what families value.

It is a little far out from the main things so you have to drive to get anywhere which is a bit of a bummer. We went to Moonstone to ski that weekend and it was about a 15 minute drive. Restaurants are all in town too so you aren't able to have a few drinks and chill out, that is the negative part.",3,negative

The resort was very well maintained. There were scheduled activities, swimming pool and hot tub. If you wanted to find other things in driving distance, it was worth the time to find out more about the history of the area. Lots to do for outdoor enthusiasts. You must let the resort know if you have someone that can't walk up the stairs because there are no elevators to get to upper rooms. This was a nice new experience for us since we also did a day trip to Toronto and nearby Barrie which had much to offer.
 
 
 Room Tip:  Definitely a car if needed for this vacation location, lots to see and do.

274630245,barrie/ca/154980/260333/274630245.html,Carriage Hills Resort,"Having stayed at the Carriage Hills/Ridge complex numerous times since opening, I just wanted to give an additional review based on our trip there this past weekend. There have been a lot of upgrades since the resort opened close to two decades ago. On this trip we found that the Carriage House must have recently undergone an extensive remodel as it appeared spotlessly clean vs. years ago. Check-in (Anne) was totally on her A game and check-in was a breeze. We were celebrating our 20th anniversary while at the resort and Tara was kind enough to organize a beautiful card for us at the check in desk.    Overall the grounds seemed to have been upgraded with a lot of recent work to the walkways, greenery (shrubs, perennials, etc.). The decks and stairways looked like they had recently been freshly painted as well.   Moreover, Carriage House staff (especially Peggy) were very friendly and professional as usual. While my husband was in the mens change room he noticed that the floor was very wet in one spot. He alerted staff and immediately a caution cone was put down. Within two minutes cleaning staff had cleaned the floor. We found this response time to be quite impressive. The one bedroom unit that we were assigned was simply fabulous. In the past we have stayed in studios, one bedrooms and two bedrooms, and found our unit to be simply spotless.  The only faults I could find on this trip was the fact that the lifeguards did nothing whatsoever to keep young children from playing and as well as jumping in the outdoor hot tub during the day, treating it like a pool vs. a hot tub. Furthermore, on three different occasion the alarm at the outdoor hot tub was accidentally set off. Lifeguards (inside) obviously heard it but did not come to check if assistance was required at the hot tub,  My only recommendation for this fabulous resort would be to extend the adult pool/hot tub hours to 11 pm instead of 10 pm. Two evenings in a row there were still a lot of adults enjoying the Carriage House pool area and were politely reminded that carriage house was closing at 10 pm. Many people commented that they wished that they could have stayed longer.  To conclude, this is a fabulous resort and am staying there again this upcoming weekend in order to enjoy some of the outdoor activities available in the area.  If you have any specific questions, please do not hesitate to message me.",5,positive

The unit was quite spacious but it is obvious it has not yet been updated. Old appliances, rickety tables on balconies. One of the biggest disappointments was the old, big TVs in the units. In this day and age even budget accommodations have flat screen TVs - not so here. Asked about swapping in a newer one but was told no. Might seem like a small thing but in a ""luxury "" resort as it is billed would expect more.  Generally, the older units look just that - old and dated.   Do not think we would stay here again.   Wifi is spotty in the units it seems too.  Also note that if you have mobility issues you WANT to ask for a ground floor unit as the second and third floor ones require many stairs .",3,negative

We enjoyed the relaxed and peaceful setting among the ski hills and woods with lovely views in this area of valleys and the natural environment.  Our one bedroom Condo was very spacious and very clean. A welcome package of items are included in the condo which was very helpful. They provide a small bottle of dishsoap, dishwasher soap, coffee and accessories, a small packet of sugars, toilet tissue, and paper towels.   We had a one bedroom with full kitchen. All the basic utensils and dishes are included in the kitchen. Linens and towels are provided. The only concern we had with the kitchen was the very noisy refrigerator. Some of the appliances should be upgraded.  The tv's are especially old and should be upgraded to flatscreen tv's. The fireplace was nice and the big bedroom with king size bed was very comfortable. There is a huge jacuzzi tub as well. This didn't work for a few days but the maintenance man came along and was fixed in no time. The bathrooms are beautiful.  Staff are very nice, warm and friendly. Checkin was a breeze at 4:00 p.m. Our unit was on the second floor which had a balcony at the back overlooking the woods. This was very nice and quiet.   There are also bbq areas around the property. They provide the bbq utensils and lighter. The grounds are very pretty and immaculate.  We enjoyed the heated indoor/outdoor swimming pool and outdoor large hot tub. This area was kept very clean. The towels are now provided in the pool area and you can deposit them as you leave in a large bin. You do not have to keep the same two towels any longer for the week. (At least this was the way it was when we were there last week).  The only major concern we had was the Internet connection. It is very slow. Most of the time you just hang. The better connection was either at the pool area or the Activities building. In this day and age, good internet connection is very important.  All in all, it was a great week. There are also many hiking trails in the area, good restaurants, shopping and golf. We hope to return.",4,positive
279957239,barrie/ca/154980/260333/279957239.html,Carriage Hills Resort,"The hubby and I stayed in a two-bedroom suite using time-share points. Our unit was very large and updated and we were pleasantly surprised as the pictures on their own website made it look a little dark and outdated, which was not the case at all. The unit was fully loaded with utensils with a full kitchen and generous counter space. There was a balcony that looked at the running track and the woods, but a personal complaint is that the balconies are not private enough; there is nothing but a back stairway and its landing separating the balconies of two adjoining units. I think a little swing gate would make this space feel much more private. Also, the wifi was almost unusable and as we are from the states and didn't want to use international roaming, that was a bit frustrating. We have no complaints at all about the unit itself, and we did not use any of the common facilities.   Just a caveat to others not from the area: when we booked we read that this was an hour from Toronto, but in reality it is really more like 2 hours, with Toronto traffic into downtown. Absolutely our mistake, but we really wanted to spend more time in Toronto. There isn't much else to do around the area (although you can check out my reviews about some places we found).",4,positive
2822623,barrie/ca/154980/260333/2822623.html,Carriage Hills Resort,"Don't trust this resort ! At best, they have incompetent staff who waste valuable time, in addition to a telemarketing program which rudely interrupts people's home life. At worst, they have unethical business practices. If you care to read further, you can make your own decision...  I thought I would take a leap of faith, and try for once trusting the intrusive and rude telemarketing offer that they made directly to my home phone number.  Against my better judgement, I listetned to their offer to visit their resort and receive a promotional overnight package at a reduced rate.  Carriage Hills qualified my attendance, then later reovoked that qualification, although I truthfully answered all of the qualification questions on both occasions. In my opinion this resort is not to be trusted.   I had decided to accept their offer to attend at my own their marketing promotion expense, and I also suggested a mutually beneficial situation where I would refer another friend to attend their marketing tour, and while on site at the tour I would discuss with them an opportunity for them to donate an overnight stay to a charity fundraising event where between 150 and 300 people would have exposure to their name and resort.  After a lengthy discussion and qualification process which included conversation with the telemarketer AND the supervisor, we all agreed, and everything was set.  Later that week I was called to confirm my reservation, and when I re-answered the qualifying questions, with the same answers I gave to qualify in the first place, I was told that I do not qualify. The sticking point was that I was 2 months outside of their criteria range for 'length of time separated'.   The person who disqualified me said ""this happens all the time, which is why we have to have a second qualification call"".   So, I spoke to one of their managers of Marketing, explaining that  1 - I was very unhappy that I was lied to, being told that I was able to attend, then was later told I am not qualified to attend, and this in my opinion consitutes unethical business practises  2 - I was very unhappy with the amount of personal time I wasted with their resort  3 - I am embarassed to have to cancel plans with the friend whom I persuaded to attend with me  4 - Their telemarketing staff had agreed to further discuss a mutually beneficial situation where they could assist a charity I volunteer for, and I could help spread awareness about their resort, and by disqualifying me based on a very small technicality, they were losing the opportunity for goodwill and additional exposure  5 - I would tell everyone I know, and as many of the public as I could about my bad experience with Carriage Hills Resort.  The manager was apologetic but felt it was more important to stick to his rules and disqualify me based on the fact that I have been separated for 48 months instead of 50 months, rather than, in the interest of good will and good public relations, apologize for the error his his resort had made, and reverse the disqualification.   This manager also claimed, in direct contradiction to the person who disqualified, that it is rare that they qualify someone then later disqualify them, when the person who did the disqualification said it happens ""all the time"".  Pity, they lost a potential customer, potential good exposure, and sullied the name of their resort, all over a matter of two months.   Lack of vision? Un-ethical business practises? Poor management skills?  The just is out... but certainly this is not a place I would choose to spend my money at!",1,negative

The weekends are busy but the week days are super quiet.  Our unit was 2112 in the Landau section - the farthest from the main building. We don't mind this as it is very quiet and peaceful. The unit is a one bedroom on the main floor. This unit has everything you could need for a comfortable stay. The bedroom has a large king size bed, plenty of clothing storage and a tv. There is a giant whirlpool tub in the washroom and a very large shower stall as well. The living room are has a pull out couch with a good mattress, another tv, a dining table and fully stocked kitchen. The carpet, walls and furniture are all in excellent condition.  The resort has BBQs on site and provides everything you need to cook a meal.  The indoor/outdoor pool is huge and very clean. It is also heated so you are able to swim comfortably even if it is a little cool outside. They offer an adult swim from 9:00pm-10:00pm. There are DVDs and games that you can borrow from the pool desk.  There is also a full compliment of activities offered for all ages. We have participated in numerous options over the years and enjoyed them all.  In the area are a few restaurants - two in Craighurst, one at the Settler's Ghost golf course and two at Horseshoe Valley resort. There are also a few golf courses in the immediate area and tons of activities at Horseshoe Resort - such a Tree Top trekking, mini putt, etc.  The only downside is the wi-fi is extremely slow. Hopefully with enough comments about this, the management will fix it.  This is a great resort.

They pay attention to the details here. You are given laundry and dish soap to start, and your supply is replenished midweek (including paper products). Your towels are exchanged at that time also.  You can walk down from your balcony to the hiking trails. There also is cross-country and downhill skiing, and snow tubing at the resort during the wintery months. I just returned, and while I was there I went on a few nice hikes early in the week without snow and also enjoyed the trails after a nice snowfall.  The Carriage House has an indoor/outdoor pool which was really something to experience in the cold weather. It also has exercise equipment and pool tables, etc. in the game room.  All in all, it's great for people who like an active, outdoor vacation (but the unit is nice if you'd prefer to sit by the fireplace too).

They lied several times in the presentation that we found out later were not even close to being true. We said no, several times and they would not take no for an answer. We were young and foolish. The saleman we dealt with has now been promoted to the top, so I guess they back up lieing to their customers as a common practise.

Carriage Ridge is in need of a major renovation and we do mean MAJOR. If you book through Interval International make sure the paperwork states that you are to be at Carriage Hills. We are planning to let Interval International know of our deep dissatisfaction... It remains to be seen just how they make up for the terrible mistake.

This resort has much to recommend, including a very good activities department and great hospitality. The bed was possibly the most comfortable I've ever had, and I had a very restful stay. I enjoyed traveling around the area, from Barrie to Penetanguishene and the Georgian Bay, which I still think is part of Lake Huron.   I had two minor problems in the unit, both of which were resolved by staff in minutes. Their current and ongoing major problem is lack of decent wifi. If you plan to work on your vacation, as I did, you won't be able to do so here. So I spent time in some of the libraries in the area during the day, when I would have preferred to do more vacation activities.   Niagara Falls is perhaps 2 to 2 1/2 hours away. The Pan Am games were on in Toronto when I was there, so the trip may have been a little longer than usual with the traffic. The resort offers day trips to both Niagara Falls and Toronto. Although I went on my own, others would enjoy the planned trip, which sounded very good.   I had a unit without a kitchen. Actually, it had a small fridge, a microwave, a toaster and the use of the outside barbecue. It was satisfactory for me, but some would want more cooking facilities. Most of the units do have full kitchens. There are no elevators in these units. There are only a few floors, but when you pack your suitcase, know you may be going up and down stairs.

As parents with children a few years apart in age, we can't say enough about this resort. The rooms are clean and well stocked. The staff is eager to assist with any request. The common areas (pool, fitness center etc.) are clean and well maintained. They have an activity calendar so you can be as relaxed or as busy as you want to be!!! A couple tips: this is a condo style hotel that ranges from 2 - 3 floors per until. If you're travelling with light sleepers, request a top floor. Can be a little noisy on the bottom, especially of a 3 floor unit. Also, it seems that the units closest to the main building (where the pool is) have all been renovated. The units farther out have not so if that is important to you, choose a until close to the main building or ask for a renovated room.
 
 
 Room Tip:  If travelling with kids, request a room closer to the main building (where the pool is).

308231681,barrie/ca/154980/260333/308231681.html,Carriage Hills Resort,"We stayed at the Carriage Hills Resort. We stayed in a 2 bedroom condo. We were amazed pulled into the resort. The grounds were impeccably landscaped and very clean. The location of the resort is in a very excellent spot. Check-in was effortless and the hostess was excellent. They are very informative and very friendly and willing to help in anyway. yes the WiFi was a little frustrating but it was not a surprise as they let you know up front that it is Basic so we really did not mind. The 2 bedroom condo was breathtaking. It was spotlessly clean and for me that is the key to my having a great and relaxing time. The spacious suites are amazing. The full kitchen was a dream, without having to go out to restaurants it was nice to cook our own meals. The appliances were top of the line and new. they were a joy to use. the kitchen I would describe as gourmet. I had brought from home different items that I thought that I might need. But to my astonishment, there was not 1 item that I could think of that I use. They are fully equipped and then some. Right down to the last detail. The spacious combined dining room and living room was unbelievable with the well chosen color of the dining table and coffee tales and end tables. The fireplace just added that extra touch to that room. The walk-out patio with the patio chairs and patio table was a nice touch. We were facing the back and the view was so beautiful , watching the sunset and the sunrise was heart-warming. The bedroom was immaculate and very spacious, the king bed was so comfortable I am a person who is very picky about a bed but it was amazing. The en-suite bathroom was stunning. They mirrors which catches every angle with the 2 adjoining sinks was a nice touch with great amount of counter space. In the en-suite bath their was a double Jacuzzi that was amazing. there was beautiful lighting that you can adjust to your liking. Through the door off the en-suite bath was the powder room which had a beautiful shower and a toilet and another sink with a lot of mirrors and counter space. I was floored by the space and the great attention to detail. We also rented the Studio suite as well which combined made the second bedroom it was just as spacious as the 1 bedroom except for the bath only had a shower which was great, and that gave us a choice of 2 patios to use. It was so quiet you would think that you were the only ones there. I loved the fact that there was a washer and dryer and i did not have to go home with dirty clothes was a nice touch. This resort is truly amazing and they have thought of every need a person could possibly want. The Hills resort is where we stayed and they had activities planned from Morning to Dinner, that was great for our child. They have a great indoor and outdoor pool with a hot tub. On the second floor is a Games room for people to enjoy. Then pool and hot tub were excellently cleaned. the water temperature inside and out was amazing. There is Adventure Park just down the hill that has so many activities and my child was thrilled. There is also a place to learn how to ride a mini bike or an ATV and my child loved that too. We took the Hummer tour and it was great. There is so much to do in an around this resort in the summer I am speaking only of the summer as I have only been to the resort in the summer. Our first time but definitely not the last. This resort is open all year round and encompasses all seasons. The Resort is well worth the money and the staff are phenomenal, you will not be sorry that you chose this resort. I would like to thank the Housekeeping staff for their impeccable cleaning of the suites.  Thank You for the great vacation that you gave us.  Boyce family",5,positive

When we arrived late on a Sunday night we were told we could have a one bedroom if we wanted, but it had not been renovated and the studio had. We chose the studio. It is very small. It was okay for us (two adults and one child). Any more than that and you won't have any room to walk around. The room was very nice. It did have a small kitchenette. And I mean very small. It's as wide as the front door which covers it when you walk in the room. The bathroom, however, was not renovated and still looked like the early 90's. It had stains in the grout and mold right underneath the shower door. I swept the entryway and the bathroom and found hair and dirt and crumbs. Yuck!! We were not happy with that. Also, you might not want to use the duvet cover. Like some other places I don't think they wash the covers. My husband smelled something and made me smell it, too, and it was man body odor. Yuck!! They brought us a clean one. My daughter and I went swimming several times and really enjoyed the pool. Ask for a towel when you go into the pool building. There is shuffleboard there and a playground, but that's it. Go next door to Horseshoe Resort for fun stuff to do. There's no restaurant on site. We bought groceries at a Foodland store in a little town close to Carriage Hills. Also, the Internet is slow.",3,negative

Reception desk staff are much more friendly and accommodating than before with requests. The resort is looking better, some painting and cleanliness issues have been resolved, although carpet stains in the rooms are still an issue, there were even what appeared to be burn marks on the carpet in our room and I thought smoking was prohibited but they supply ashtrays so very confused about this rule (we are non smokers). The pool sundeck area has greatly improved and there are many more sun lounges and picnic areas to accommodate guests which is a big plus, nicer pool towels as well but they shouldn't limit each guest to just one each as they are small. More umbrellas would be nice. The WIFI at the resort is still very frustrating and archaic, it really should be updated ... do away with ATT if they cannot provide the kind of service needed in this day and age. We again got approached by their sales staff to attend a presentation but it was refreshing that this time they actually took NOT INTERESTED for an answer but somehow they did call us twice while there, the first week and second week. They should keep a record of who they called and when so guests don't get called more than once. Overall very happy with our accommodations and their attention to maintenance of a/c queries in the room was very fast. Thank you Wyndham, I see great improvements. Hope it continues.

We had been there a few years ago and enjoyed a 2 bedroom. However the studio was fine for just the two of us. We had a king size bed, queen size sofa bed, and a small table and chairs. The bathroom was quite large with a good sized shower, and no tub. The kitchen area was very small, and everything had to be moved just to use the toaster. There was no stove......had a bar frig, microwave, coffeepot, and kettle. There were all the utensils we needed. So we had most breakfasts and lunches, and went out for dinner. The staff was very friendly and helpful. The maintenance man came quickly to fix small issues. The girls came once to change towels, and take the garbage. They left us a little bag of treats. We got to the resort at 2:15, and they let us check in then. The pool was good and they supplied towels. Since the resort was not fully booked they let a person have two. We went to a barbeque on Sunday evening, with donations going to a charity. We played bingo one day. There was no charge to play. We went on the hummer tour, which was great fun. Craighurst is a close village. There are a couple of good restaurants and other interesting shops.....including a chocolate factory.

Or, one can just sit and relax under the tree with the birds chirping.  On this second visit, the fuse blew on the microwave - TWICE! So, had to call someone to restart things. Front desk sent the person quickly - minor inconvenience. One outlet in the kitchen was not working. One situation was that our room was not cleaned on the day it was scheduled. It was embarrassing when our family friends came over for two days while we were gone. Towels were on the floor waiting to be replaced and beds were unmade.

We were disappointed as our room wasn't as clean (particularly the bathroom) as we expected from a resort like this to be. Decor was outdated and wifi was almost non-existent.

318547513,barrie/ca/154980/260333/318547513.html,Carriage Hills Resort,"Stayed at this resort late spring in order to partake in treetop trekking at nearby Horseshoe Resort. As usual, resort was great, you can tell that there is new ownership due to additional renovations and upgrading of grounds/maintenance.   We had a very minor maintenance issue and had the pleasure of meeting JOHN the maintenance technician. He is a long time employee of the resort and we had a great conversation with him. He is incredibly proud of the resort and makes a huge effort. The resort is lucky to have him.    We have stayed at this resort over a dozen times now in all room types. The only negative aspect of this resort (as I have stated in previous reviews and emails to management over the years) is the fact that the adult swim time ends too early. Each time at the end of the adult swim time, it is apparent that a lot of individuals are really enjoying themselves and would really like to have additional pool/hot tub time.The resort should consider extending the adult swim time by another hour. The carriage hills pool temperature seems difficult to maintain (I have stayed at this resort two weekends in a row on more then one occasion and one weekend the water temperature seems great, the next weekend, very cool and vice versa). I assume that this issue is due to the nature (indoor/outdoor) of the pool. It would be great if the inside pool temperature could be increased by a few degrees during spring/fall and winter to offset this issue. Over the years I have received emails from the resort regarding both of these pool issues and have been told that the information would be forwarded to the pool staff, but there has yet to be a change with either policy.   All in all, this is an immaculate resort with top notch staff. A true four seasons experience that we enjoy immensely during each visit.",5,positive

The resort didn't have as many amenities as some other places, but we had a nice stay at Carriage Hills.  The check-in and check-out procedure was smooth, and the staff was top-notch throughout our stay. We needed some help from the maintenance crew to start the outdoor gas grill, and the maintenance guy arrived relatively quickly and was quite helpful and gregarious. As one minor quibble, I was perplexed that a resort within an hour of a major city like Toronto did not have a Toronto map available for guests.  WIthin our unit, we had the full two-bedroom suite (i.e. the one-bedroom unit and the adjacent studio unit combined). It was more than enough space for two couples, and it wouldn't have been too much trouble to have some more folks, especially kiddos, with us. We enjoyed the jacuzzi tub on several nights. The bathrooms were quite spacious. The full kitchen allowed us to cook many meals throughout the week and save some money. The kitchen wasn't anything fabulous, but fully functional and sufficiently spacious. And as mentioned above, we had access to outdoor gas grills in a gazebo at the end of our building, which allowed us the unique opportunity on vacation to grill hamburgers one night. Though it was too hot to be necessary, the gas fireplace was a nice touch. We enjoyed watching several movies on the large TV. And free wireless internet access was quite helpful.  We enjoyed some nearby golf at Orr Lake Golf Club (the cheapest nearby course, which was decent but nothing special) and also a 1-hour trail ride at a horse stable, both of which were within 15 minutes of the timeshare. We played tennis for free at the nearby Horseshoe Valley Resort. And we loved the indoor-outdoor pool (one pool, in which you could swim under the plastic, carwash-like divider to go back and forth from the indoor and outdoor portions of the pool) and indoor and outdoor hot tubs at the activity building at Carriage Hills. It was clean, beautiful, and very well-designed.  We spent several days in Toronto during our week at Carriage Hills, and though it would have been nice to have been a bit closer (a 1-hour drive to and from Toronto felt very long on top of full days in the city), it was very easy access. The concierge at Carriage Hills recommended that we park at Yorkdale Mall on the north end of Toronto and take the subway into the heart of the city, which worked out fabulously for us.  Overall, we had a great time in Ontario at Carriage Hills Resort. If we decided to vacation again in this area, I'd be quite happy to stay here again!!",4,positive

This is a 5 star resort with everything. Huge 2 bedroom accommodations, skiing, golfing, hiking, restaurants, pools, etc etc. Yes - a car is handy if you want to move around the resort grounds or into town - but not essential. The sales pitch is anything but ""high pressure"" or unethical. I did not sign up for the promotional deal. I felt that if they were being persistant or if I felt uncomfortable - I would just leave, as I was under no obligation. I began the session by telling my rep that we were interested in a timeshare here, but were not impluse buyers and would not, under any circumstances, purchase today - on the spot. She still spent almost 2 hours with us outlining ownership benefits and took us on a tour.  At the end of the presentation we said thank-you and departed. Now that we know all of the details and have seen the place, we are planning our next visit to purchase. Bottom line - it is an incredible resort - from the accommodations to the amenities. 20 mins to the Casino, 45 mins to Wonderland, 15 mins to the marina - or never leave the resort. If you are easily pressured, and only looking for a cheap promotional weekend - stay away.

Carriage Ridge and Carriage Hills are two timeshare resorts (Carriage Hills is probably a bit newer); part of them can be booked hotel-style.

We slept in a great studio suite, very comfortable and very well kept (it also has a microwave oven, fridge, kitchen “stuff”). When asked we chose the third (last) floor to minimize possible noise problems; we also got a great view from the balcony. The refrigerator started making an annoying noise/vibration at some point so we turned it off (not an issue for a short stay).  Besides the accommodation there isn’t much else in the resort: a pool, a small games room, and a “library” room (plus many public barbecues around the buildings).

Pool area - I found the pool water to be freezing this year so not sure if something wasnt working on the heater? The hot tubs were awesome and the whole area was well maintained and clean. They close at 10 which is usual but disappointing.  My only complaint was the wifi was horrible but thats because of the amount of people trying to use it in the evenings.

We can't thank Leslie and Julie enough who co-ordinate our annual snow shoeing around the property ground and even went out with us this weekend when it was minus 30!

348713354,barrie/ca/154980/260333/348713354.html,Carriage Hills Resort,"Winter or summer....do it your way. Carriage Ridge/Hills Resort in Shanty Bay, Ontario, Canada is approximately 90 minutes from Toronto. A summer/winter resort with the right amenities to relax and vacate from the hustle and bustle of the city. My advice: bring food, munchies, DVD's/cards, skis/golf clubs, wool socks/bathing suit. Do you have snowshoes? Great trails. Adventurous or lazy? Do everything...or do nothing. Activities will cost you but you'll have fun. Relaxing with a book...by the pool? Nothing wrong with that. And won't cost you a cent. Again this is where I go back to ""bring your own""....to help your pocket book. Let me explain. You are charged fees for: DVD's, games, snowshoes, skate rental ($8 for 2 hours) and the bigger ticket items like tubing (but wait...an unlimited option... Friday's 4 p.m. to 10 p.m. for $15 ...guess you know who will be in THAT line!); ski lift tickets...tip: check out Liftopia on-line for lift ticket discounts (and yes, even with the high exchange rate it still may cost you less than our CDN dollar). You can book a studio room with a bar fridge and microwave or a one-bedroom with a full kitchen. I always cook thus opting for a one-bedroom. There's nothing like morning skiing and returning to the room for some hot soup. I've always had a room where I can step out the back door, drop my skis on the snow and I'm off. You can request this when you reserve and check-in. Wait no longer. Book and go. Your getaway awaits!
 
 
 Room Tip:  Low floor if you have a lot to carry; ask for a room near a chair lift if you ski.

34917750,barrie/ca/154980/260333/34917750.html,Carriage Hills Resort,"Warning: I'm wordy. Three friends and I snatched up a Travelzoo deal and booked a quick night away as an escape from Toronto life. The rooms looked nice on the website sure, but is reality ever as nice as it's advertised? No! So I wasn't really getting my hopes up. Just wanted to relax with the girls, drink a few cosmos, flip through some fashion mags, watch some movies. As soon as we opened the door to our suite we dropped our bags in girly excitement and were immediately pressured by one in our party: ""You all have to get out of work on Monday. Call in sick!"". The pictures on the website don't even do the rooms justice. Sadly the suite was much nicer than my own apartment. The decor was fab. The suite was a great size (as was the tv) and clean, complete with jacuzzi, vanity, balconi, fridge, blender (essential for girly drinks), toaster oven, stove (loved the fact that you can be lazy, sleep in, and then make your own bacon and eggs, and daiquiri in the morning :) ), dishwasher (hello!),...and dishes. The only thing missing was martini glasses. Bring your own ladies. Needless to say we booked a second night and were given an even greater deal. The staff was very helpful with everything we asked about. At the Carriage Ridge Resort there is only an indoor pool (adequate size) and a hot tub, but there is a sun deck and lounge chairs if you happen to visit during a summer that is warm enough to sit outside. That was not the case with our weekend, so thank goodness for the heated indoor pool. Also admirable is the adult swim time from 9-10:00 pm, if like myself you have a fear of children. At the pool/recreation centre you can also rent out games for your room free of cost which is a great idea if you're staying in. It's located in the countryside, so bring bug spray if you spend any time outdoors, as I learned the hard way. There's not tons to do in the immediate area off the resort if you don't golf...one day a couple of the girls made a valiant effort to try the dirt bikes available for rent, but found it a little more pricey than desired.  Another plus is that about a five minute drive away is a convenient combined Foodland/LCBO/Beer Store. There's no other buildings in the town besides a gas station. This will cover basically all your needs in one stop, and was great for buying things to bbq, as there are bbq pavillions at the resort which we used a couple of times. As for any negatives, the only complaint I could think of is that we weren't allowed to use the indoor/outdoor pool at the neighbouring Carriage Hills Resort (so keep that in mind when deciding which resort to book if the pool matters to you). Also the drain in the shower in our room was clogged with hair the first day (not really a fan of being that up close and personal with the previous guests, no offense, I'm sure they were nice people). Other than that it was immaculately clean and all in all it was a great place and we started planning our next trip back immediately. We even decided we might keep it to ourselves rather than rave about it to our friends and keep it as our own little retreat of the privileged invited elite.",5,positive

This is the perfect place to go to to relax. We had a car so we were able to drive to Toronto and the nearby downtown Barrie, which has a very nice beach.

Upon arrival the rooms were clean, check-in was quick and they were staffed appropriately. 2 bedroom suites are actually 2 separate rooms that adjoin via a central foyer. Both units were exactly as explained on the website, and we were very impressed with the amount of space we had. I would definitely rent this room again and would recommend this resort to friends and family. We took advantage of the Mount St Louis package, which included 2 ski lift passes with our stay at Carriage Hills. Amazing value!!!!  The resort is quite spaced out and the building we were staying in was the farthest away from the Carriage House which contains the pool, gym, and games room. I drove up to the Carriage house to take the kids for a swim only to discover there were only about 8 parking spaces located there which were all occupied. I did have to park a ways away and walk. The pool area is quite nice and staffed with a lifeguard at the time we were there. Change rooms are clean, and towels are provided. The pool water itself was on the cold side.... I figured for an indoor/outdoor pool it would have been better heated. My son swam for a while, but it was too cold for my liking. This was the only thing I would have changed about my stay here.

It is one of my favorite resorts and places to visit in the fall. I have stayed 3 times, The first time was for 1 week, second time 3 night stay. I have stayed in the one Bedroom Apartment Style Suite each time. It has a full kitchen with everything, a living room and a separate bedroom. The rooms felt very comfortable and lovely. My first 2 stays were great no issues at all. My last stay was a 2 night stay and the first night was an absolute nightmare. The resort check in line had two people in front of me and I waited a half hour in line while they tried to sell ""ownership"" so I had to wait...when it was my turn I found the agent horribly rude to me but I was excited to get to our room as we had plans that evening. I could go on and on with my negative recount of the evening but to keep it short the room was dirty and broken down the wifi was not working and not at all what I expected from the hotel at all. Simple...call the front desk right? Yes literally 15 times because they never called back like they promised. After dealing with rudeness and finally being offered a new clean room we lugged our bags down 3 icey flights of stairs loaded back into the car, drove back to the office got our new key and drove to the next building and carried what we could back up the icey steps to enter our new improved room. When we opened the door we were greeted by the most lovely couple celebrating a special anniversary weekend away. I felt so bad for walking in on them and interrupting their romantic celebration but they (hotel staff) obviously screwed up and gave us simeone elses room??!? This is a nightmare situation and the reason why there are deadbolts on doors!! But the couple was so kind and felt so bad for us they even in all their shock they wanted to help us!!!! Anyway the story goes on and it wasted 5 hours of my night literally running around in the dark in freezing rain trying to get to my room. I ended up cold and getting sick but the room was absolutly lovely. Carriage Hills failed on this third stay, and the service from the staff to help was terrible. They could have done better, especially when it was so painfully obvious they failed miserably. Will try 1 more time only because I have so many great memories here and have hope it will be better.

3744574,barrie/ca/154980/260333/3744574.html,Carriage Hills Resort,"This place is the worst resort I've been to. The people who write that Carriage Hills is an excellent resort have obviously not been to a decent resort. Although the staff is friendly, they're very unflexible. I have a family of 5 and they expected us to stay in the tiny little room with ONE bed and a pull-out sofa. I understand the 'no pets' rule but this is the first resort that has actually stated it will 'charge' you if they catch you with a pet. They'll charge you $250 + damages; I like how they say 'charge' and not 'fine'. This place is obviously out to get every penny out of you. There's no wonder Horseshoe Valley disolved their relationship with Carriage Hills; this place is unprofessional and is in a mess. Without Horseshoe they have absolutley NOTHING to do there. No Golf, No Ski, No Hiking or anything for that matter. The ONLY activity they have out is their pool and bbq. This is the first place I've been to that mentions their pool 3 times in their sales package; probably due to their lack of activities in this garbage resort. And beware of their tight security, they have a couple guys in a pickup truck strolling around constantly trying to catch people with pets or people that exceed the maximum occupancy; it's disgusting. Carriage Hills is so low that count even infants as ONE person (only place that I know of that would do that). This means if you have 2 adults, 1 child and 2 babies, they'll charge you extra or make you move into a larger room. And guess what? it costs a lot more for you but does it cost them a lot more that you're carrying a baby? Absolutly not, so why would they do that? Not that I have this problem but friends of ours wouldn't come to the resort with us because of that problem. It's just a hassle staying at Carriage Hills, more than any other resort they state all of their rules in strict and unfriendly manner. I know that sounds dumb at first; but they outline their rules and guidelines in a condecending and unprofessional manner. You'll know what I mean if you try calling in and make a reservation. Anyways, I think you get the point. This place ----. Take my word, Horeshoe is right next to it. If anything go there.

We stayed from May 23 to 29, 2016. Our stay was in a studio unit on the 3rd. floor with our balcony looking out over the parking lot. Due to the direction of sun rises and sunsets and the hot afternoon sun, this balcony turned out to be in the perfect location to enjoy morning coffee and breakfast and shaded afternoons and nice evenings without scorching sunshine forcing us indoors. We thoroughly enjoyed our studio unit! Unfortunately it only had a microwave to warm food and a toaster but no range, so we could not cook any meals. That would be the only reason that next time we visit we will book a suite with a full kitchen. From the moment we checked in to check out a week later, we found every Resort Staff Member that we met to be very friendly, knowledgeable, helpful, and just pleasant to meet! We enjoyed the indoor/outdoor pool, hot tubs, sauna, games room, gym, barbecues and walking trails around the area. Everything was well maintained and in good condition. Another good feature about staying at Carriage Hills is it's close proximity to so many near by places of interest such as museums, restaurants, marinas, historical and heritage sites, parks, picnic areas, and many other places to visit for interest, entertainment and fun, Even Casino Rama is only about a 30 minute drive from the Resort.

Other unit was a studio with king size bed and queen pull out bed, kitchenette and balcony, we kept the two inner doors open) Units need to be updated from the 80's, but the units were very clean. We spent most of our time down at the pool area, very relaxing. The best tip for the weekend was to take the free shuttle down to Horseshoe Valley and back. Our driver NICK was amazing, he picked us up, and came back to pick us up when we called. This meant we parked the car for the entire weekend. No drinking and driving!  Only complaint would be that our units were not ready when we arrived and we were told to come back for 4pm. We arrived back at 5pm and the units were still being cleaned. Management apologized and offered a late checkout for us.  Because this is a time share resort we got a phone call asking us to attend a showcase. We declined and weren't bothered again.

My daughter had a separate suite adjoining ours, with a private entrance to our shared outer door. The suites were nicely laid out and furnished. My wife and my suite had a large living room, a separate bedroom, good-sized kitchen area, separate baths, a jacuzzi, large walk-in shower, and a shared toilet. Our daughter's room was a studio-type space, but well appointed. We had our own clothes washer and dryer.  We had a king bed, which was very comfortable. I think our daughter's was a queen.  The free WiFi was a little slow, but worked. We were in the Victoria building, which is a short walk from the indoor/outdoor pool. I'm not a big swimmer but it was quite nice. The indoor area was not inundated with chlorine, as at some places, and the water temp was cool, I'm guessing in the high 80s.  There is not a lot else to do on-site. There is a video arcade above the pool, and apparently a pool table somewhere, but I didn't see it. They have a sand volleyball court, with a sagging net, but nobody was using it, that I saw.  There are a few restaurants nearby, but not much else. One convenience store/gas station, and one supermarket, about 5 miles away. We mostly used this as a base of operations to check out Georgian Bay (30 min.), Lake Simcoe (30 min.) and Toronto (80 miles, time depends on traffic). I did some hiking in Copeland Forest, which is very close and has a lot of hiking/biking trails. There is some skiing nearby too. So, nice place, friendly staff, good rooms.

We wanted to take our son and his two boys with us for a brief change. Things were much as we had experienced them on the previous visit--beautifully kept quarters, large, bright rooms fully equipped with up-to-date equipment. We were on the main floor because of some handicapped issues. The back (including a balcony) of our main area looked out on greenspace--meadow and trees. The main activity building was well-stocked and clean. The pool area was well-used by our family: begin inside and swim out. There was a myriad of activities for the children, which they loved because they always won a prize. They particularly enjoyed tie-dying. For $8 they got a well-made T-shirt and tie-dyed it themselves (with some help!)--true masterpieces. The resort is central to Barrie, Orillia, and Georgian Bay, with lots of attractions at reasonable prices. Without question, our quarters were the cleanest we have experienced in many years. The only downside was Wi-Fi, which did not work at all, or kept coming and going. The management is without excuse for that cardinal flaw. That said, we would recommend Carriage Hills to all and sundry as a great place for a vacation!

We thoroughly enjoy this resort and surrounding countryside. Our unit was on the second floor overlooking the woods behind. We love it because it is so peaceful and the unit was very quiet - no noise from surrounding neighbours.   The one bedroom unit is fully equipped with a full kitchen, livingroom with fireplace, large bedroom with a king sized bed. There is a beautiful large bathroom with jacuzzi tub and double sink vanity which also connects to another smaller bathroom with vanity and shower. This opens back onto the main area of kitchen/entrance area.   All towels and linens are supplied which are changed mid week. The entrance area to the two different units also has a small room with full sized washer/dryer. The recycling blue boxes are kept in this room as well.  The only negative comment I can make is that the refrigerators are dated and very noisy but after awhile we became used to it. The fridge also has an ice maker in it. Furniture seemed newer as well as carpeting. The door at the back of the livingroom opens onto a balcony with chairs and table. It was nice to sit out here and listen to the birds in the trees. Central a/c which works very well with adjustable thermostat.  The pool area is lovely with nice large outdoor hot tub. Lots of loungers and umbrellas were available which seemed new also. Indoor/outdoor pool with sauna are very nice. Very clean.   Internet cabling was being installed while we were there so hopefully internet access will be much better once this construction work has been completed.   Trails are accessible from the resort as well as zip line activity through the trees.   You are not pressured by timeshare people which is nice. They call once to ask you to come to a meet and greet but we didn't participate. They respect your wishes.  The grounds are kept immaculate. We will definitely be back.   The little village nearby of Craighurst has mostly everything you need - grocery store, LCBO, hair salon, organic market, and a few quaint shops and restaurants. Golf is nearby.   We hope to return again.
 
 
 Room Tip:  We enjoy having a unit overlooking the woods.

We had so much to do, because the location is great for many things. On Friday, due to the rain, we could not take advantage of the activities and Horseshoe Valley, so we went to the Tanger Outlets. About 30 minute drive and a great way to spend a rainy afternoon. Saturday was fun-filled with Zip lines, Tree-Trekking, Wall Climbing, Mini Put and Mazes. We had a great get away. Only negative was the Wi-Fi. It was terrible, but I hear that it is being improved.",5,positive

This is less than one week away from arrival and there is no other hotels in the area or in Barrie with vacancy. The hotel wasn't even apologetic.

395961918,barrie/ca/154980/260333/395961918.html,Carriage Hills Resort,"Another lovely holiday at Carriage Hills. We enjoy our time here year after year. It is a wonderful well appointed resort with lovely staff NOW. There was a mix-up/error made with our second week reservation request but since Wyndham took over it seems that their staff really do care how you feel and try to make good and compensate their guests in any way possible for any issues or mistakes experienced. Katie Peach is amazing and made what was a difficult situation to us much better and resolved to our satisfaction and then some.   WIFI still sucks but they are working on improvements with Bell but no definite date when completion will be as yet. We were told August or sometime in early Fall.  Some of the units need to be inspected closer for major things like dirty stained carpets. Our's was in terrible condition. It is unfortunate that some guests are slobs and don't care if they wreck the place because it's not their's but for guests like us who do care and respect the property, it's a big turn off when you go into your unit and the first thing you notice is a filthy looking carpet. It would be nice if major spills on carpets were cleaned up as soon as possible or as soon as they are identified by housekeeping staff. Maybe a room should be taken out of service when this happens until it has been cleaned.   There are unsightly cracked marble tiles in the bathrooms that have been there for years from the shifting of the building. I would think they would be fairly easy to repair or filled in with some sort of cement to make them look better for guests but year after year you see the same cracks that have been ignored. We notified housekeeping of these issues that were in the unit we were in and they were very responsive. The housekeeping staff and maintenance staff are so amazing with any requests or issues and respond almost immediately to resolve if it is possible. Tara Craftchick in particular was especially attentive to our needs. She really cares about guests at the resort as well.   We were disappointed to find Carriage Ridge under major reconstruction as we have booked in there for two weeks in August. At the time we reserved (or at some point in time) it would have been nice if we had been notified of the construction and maybe given the choice/opportunity to make other plans or to book next year instead but Carriage Hills have kindly booked us into that resort for the same time frame. It was disappointing though as we were looking forward to our holiday in Carriage Ridge.  All in all we had an amazing time at Carriage Hills as always and thanks to the wonderful staff there, the few concerns we had were or will be rectified in the future.

I and a member of my family both have mobility issues which precludes the use of stairs. This has happened 3 times and it has been attributed to a computer program problem. Couldn't it be fixed in 3 years???? To their credit, they have always been able to find an appropriate unit but it has delayed our access to our unit. Two bedroom units have a studio lock out with a mini kitchen and kingsize bed. The main part of the unit has a full kitchen, large living area and bedroom with a king size bed. If you book as a 2 bedroom, you can sleep 8 (2 pull out couches). A washer and driver is available in unit. That being said, everything after check in was been great. Good facilities, good staff, nice grounds. Love the indoor/outdoor pool. Winter visits are as another reviewer said magical. I have now been at Carriage Hills in the coldest recorded winter week and the hottest most humid one this summer. A car is needed to explore the surrounding areas and to do any grocery shopping in nearby Craighurst. The Orillia Walmart and Rama Casino are about 30 minutes away. Great dining at the Settler's Ghost Golf Club. Ample portions for a reasonable price served on a covered patio or indoors at a spot just 5 minutes away. Chocolate Factory in Craighurst was expensive and there was nothing special about the chocolate. Looking forward to next summer's visit.

All of the rooms are surrounded by forest, and there are paths that let you get close enough to nature without having to rough it.  You have the option to explore the forest, but If you are just wanting a quiet retreat from the city, you can relax on the balcony and enjoy a drink.  The pool at the Carriage House and the arcade/billiards room are what make this place great for kids. They provide life jackets and pool noodles so the kids can let loose and have fun. There are life guards for added eyes, but everyone is there to have fun so you don't have to worry about your kid splashing someone in the face with water.  I will definitely be back.",5,positive

It was great, the unit was first rate, we had a 2 bedroom unit. We are owners at Carriage Ridge, a sister resort, but this was the first time we have stayed here. The staff were very helpful and the common facilities were well maintained. It is a good place to relax and enjoy the quiet. We attended a number of activities put on by the resort and our grandson loved them. Yes, there are rules, i.e. no pets and maximum number of persons per unit, and I am glad they are enforced. We went on a promotional sales session and got $100 in gas coupons. We said no thankyou to buying additional time and were not hounded for saying no. If you hate listening to sales pitches don't go!

The air conditioners in the Hansom building (rooms 2000-2015 & 2200-2215) are, by admission of the maintenance staff, somewhat flakey. We checked in on a Friday for a weeks stay, a son Sunday the air conditioning stopped working. We end up getting a fan for Sunday night, and a fairly noisy portable a/c unit for Monday and Tuesday. The regular a/c unit was fixed on Tuesday afternoon. Finally, the wifi is TERRIBLE!! Don't come here if you can't disconnect from the Internet while you're here. Promises if improved wifi were left unfulfilled. There were lots of things to do and we had an enjoyable time that just could have been great.",4,positive

Construction on units around our unit detracted from the view and was dangerous for children playing. I know it is temporary but who wants to spend a vacation in a construction zone with the noise, heavy equipment running around the parking lot, building materials stacked every where and delivery trucks blocking the entrance? Besides that the weight machine in the gym was missing parts and pretty much inoperable and the wood floor had puddles of water from condensation dripping from the A/C vents.

The only thing that we were not satisfied with was the wifi internet. Extremely slow. In speaking with staff there they are in the process of changing over to fiber op so this little problem should be solved. We would certainly return to this resort again.

The place is still maintained very well and the units are very clean. They have replaced the carpets and furniture, but still kept the 90's theme. The only thing new was they put in a DVD player instead of the VHR. We had a studio which does not have a stove or oven. They have BBQ's but only 2 per building unless you are near the check-in area which have 4 BBQ for 4 buildings. We waited for over an hour to use the BBQ near our unit and gave up Since we were on the 3rd floor we packed our cooler with our meat/utensils/dishes/condiments, etc and lugged it to the other end of building. Again it was busy. They should have the BBQs closer to the units and more of them to use. Also their air conditioning units are placed on the tiny balconies. The deck chairs are wooden and uncomfortable and when the A/C turned on you could feel the vibrations Also the A/C units were not quiet so hard to have a conversation. So if you want to sit on the balcony you have to turn the A/C off. The TVs in our unit was the old style from the 90's so when another unit changed the channel you lost reception. But the biggest drawback was NO INTERNET. We stayed for 3 days and it finally come on faintly on our last night. The pool area did get new chairs however the water could have used more heat so not many people stayed in for very long There is not much to do other than use the pool The shuffleboard are was awkward to get to and the walking path was basically along the back of the buildings. Good for 1 night stay or if you are into golfing and need a place to crash but not as a stand alone resort",3,negative

415413720,barrie/ca/154980/260333/415413720.html,Carriage Hills Resort,"August of this year was our second visit to Carriage Hills Resort, Shanty Bay, Ontario. July last year was our first visit. Why did we go back? Our grand children had a really good time last year and remembered every detail of it; including how long it took to get there, the activities – on site and off site-, the shops close by and of course the pools. This year we did not do as much shopping close by as last year though we did go to the grocery store, liquor store and Chelsea Chocolate Factory. On site, most of our time was spent in the pools. The air around the indoor pool was very humid on most days, and the air around the outside pool was very hot. This, however, did not prevent us from using the pools. The pool staff – life guards and towel attendants – was quite pleasant and helpful. The other activities we participated in on site included face painting, bingo, necklace making and tie-dyeing. The latter activity produced some colourful t-shirts. Unfortunately, it rained the day we BBQ’d using the BBQ units the resort provided. The finished product was none-the-less quite tasteful. We stayed in a unit on the second floor. The unit was comfortable for the four of us. The utensils and fixtures in the kitchen were sufficient and in good working condition. Once we had a problem with the toilet, which we reported and was fixed. The buildings on the resort are surrounded by lovely green trees, plants and bushes, giving guests a feeling of serenity, peacefulness and seclusion. I took a walk along the “chipmunk trail”. The trail is all earth, with alternating high and low areas. While it may not be challenging for an experienced or professional hiker, it surely took some effort to traverse. None-the-less the walk was pleasant and worthwhile. Twice I saw a reddish-brown chipmunk gathering acorns but was not quick enough to get a picture. Its close proximity to major/large metropolis in Ontario makes it easily accessible and an attractive alternative to traveling very long distances. We may likely visit again, though not in the very near future.

417653082,barrie/ca/154980/260333/417653082.html,Carriage Hills Resort,"We visited this resort about three years ago. Once again, the rooms were comfortable and adequately supplied with most of the needs for daily activities. Our co-visitor loves to do all her own cooking. We had an adequate supply of dishes, glasses, pots & pans for us to cook in. The rooms were clean and the mid-week cleaning was fine. Our main complaint was that the jacuzzis both at the indoor and outdoor pools were not working. These worked fine on our previous visit to this resort. When we asked others about this problem, we were told they had not been working at all this year or even the previous year. We find it hard to believe that a resort could allow this type of problem to go on for such an extended period of time. We have to admit we did not go to the front desk to complain about this. However, we clearly got the message from other people that this issue had been raised many timets and nothing had been done to repair the problem. We used the grills on many nights. Unfortunately, one night the grills ran out of gas. We were told there was a problem and nothing could be done about it right away. This meant we had to finish cooking our steaks in the oven broiler - this does not make for good steak!! The next night the grills did work. There are many interesting places to visit within a reasonable distance - Toronto Zoo, SS Kewatin, Jesuit settlement, etc. The area is beautiful. The Canadian drivers are extremely aggressive. Leave a few inches between you and the next car and they will cut you off. In general, a pleasant trip. A few things could have been better. We have never been to a resort where the jacuzzi's did not work. This definitely has to be taken care of. I clicked no wifi below because although they said there was wifi, it was pretty much non-existent during our visit. They did say they were working to improve this. However, I was never successful in getting my laptop logged in. My husband, occasionally, got his iPad to log-in.

The room was fine for us except the bed was extremely hard. They offered to give us a topper for the bed which turned out to be an extremely thin mattress pad. Not sure why they thought that would help?  The majority of reviews said internet doesn't work. Well it does as long as the resort isn't crowded. My IT husband said that improvements could be made to their internet service now to help the problem until fiber is installed (which can take years). Basically there are only so many IP addresses available so if they are all taken no one else can connect. This happened to use only during the weekend but during the week the internet worked great.

Special shout out to Jon from Maintenance who was there to get the job done and very personable. The Carriage house where the pool is, is great everything you may need that you might have forgot at home is there. The staff there are always smiling. Travelling with children, they loved the pool. The pool is a indoor/outdoor pool where you can swim inside then go outside still swimming. The rooms are very clean and neat. We had the one bedroom, which was a little smaller then the one bedroom at Carriage Ridge. If you do go ask for an modern or updated room. The decor is updated. Also with the one bedroom you have pretty much everything there, all you need to do is bring you food. Which is very helpful when travelling with children. If you like outdoor activities then this is the place to go, you can do almost everything outside, with Horseshoe Valley Ski resort 5 mins away (by car) or 20 mins walking, you have a lot to do.

The only down sides to this resort is that there is no dining facility or store, you have to have a vehicle to get around. During the week we went to the 400 Flea and Antique market and got some good deals. We also went to the Elmvale Zoo and really enjoyed it. All rooms are non-smoking so we smoked on our little balcony which was fine except for the really cold days. The grocery store, liquor and beer store are about a 5 minute drive away which was handy. They have community bbq's set up to use and if you need bbq untensils you can borrow them from the Carriage House. They supplied toilet paper, paper towels, laundry soap, dish soap and dishwasher soap which was nice. All in all it is a very nice resort and I would rate it a 4 star. If it had more ammenities it would be a 5.",4,positive

Sure, there are few restaurants and bars etc. but the place IS REMOTE as is advertised, in ski country, its not their fault there are no restaurants around. Go to the grocery store before arrival and stock up, the kitchen in the suites will more than accommodate any kind of cooking.

5360274,barrie/ca/154980/260333/5360274.html,Carriage Hills Resort,"Carriage Hills. Superb accommodation. Excellent, friendly and attentive staff. Lovely spot, relaxing, quiet. But not a lot of features really if you take time to examine it, good kids play area and the one amongst the trees in the wood is fantastic. There are just dozens of rope bridges and other sorts of jungle stuff, I imagine you could stay in there for days if you were a kid! We saw all this when we walked through the wood down to the Horseshoe Resort, it only took us 20 mins there but 25 to get back as it was quite challenging in places. I think that’s where we must have picked up the majority of our bug bites. Oh, I’d not mentioned it before, May/June is big bug time in Canada. Use plenty of repellent and you’ll be ok if you stay out of the bush! The rosort also has a nice indoor/outdor pool and a gym with various pieces of equipment. There are also BBQ areas near the condos with gas piped on, all free and they even loan you the utensils if you want, so you can really BBQ yourself to death if you have a need. The entertainments team do stage various daily activities if you are into these sort of group ego trips, but I think above all the place is good to relax in. Some folks have commented about noise and the like, but we didn't experience this at all. We were on the top of a 3 floor condo, so maybe this location served us well.  The accommodation. What did we get? A fantastic great lounge with a dining table, 6 chairs, 3 seater settee, 2 armchairs, fireplace, mega size TV, HiFi and DVD, dish washer, big oven, micro, big fridge with ice maker (wow) and every cooking appliance you can think of! I thought I’d died and gone to heaven! We also got 2 bedrooms as well, each one also had a Big TV and DVD. Both had showers but one had a really big one, his and her’s basins and a Jacuzzi, that would fit 2! There was also a laundry room with industrial size washer and drier (free of charge usage and was even issued soap powder to use in it!). The area around Carriage is lovely, you see it’s very flat where we live so it’s really nice to be amongst lots of hills and trees. Our only gripe would be that there is no restaurant or bar on site. There is a golf club bar/diner within walking distance of the resort but it's nothing to write home about! Everything else is a drive. Would we stay again? Of course!",4,positive

55428960,barrie/ca/154980/260333/55428960.html,Carriage Hills Resort,"My boyfriend and I stayed at Carriage Hills in March of 2008 and were hesitant to return as we had a bad experience with cleanliness and the noises the furnace made. Hence 2 years later and reluctant to return, I telephoned and spoke with the Supervisor Jaqueline. From this point on the rest is history! We arrived on the 3rd and left on the 6th. Jacquline and her staff notably Christine made both of us feel cared for. We went up planning to stay for two nights ended up staying for three. The difference in our experiences was exponentially different. We were given a room with privacy(no one above us), when we went to the front desk to easily purchase snow tube tickets for horseshoe valley I mentioned we would be returning after 9 to use the hot tub. Christine advised nobody would be present to sign out locker keys to us, so she immediately called over to the Carriage house desk to leave a lock out, although she didn't have to! She went out of her way without neither my boyfriend nor I asking. We enjoyed ourselves so much we decided to stay another night....easily done. One phonecall to Christine and it was done! Jacqueline(supervisor) was just as accomodating. The week I booked I found out someone had fraudlently used our c/c hence now we may not receive one in time for our stay. I immediately contacted Jacqueline yet again....so sorry to be a pain but Jacqueline was very attentive assuring me no worries, everything all worked out! Thank you to you Jacueline and Christine for all your attentiveness!  The room - was immaculate upon arrival and no distractions. We did the ""Go Green"" package, no housekeeping just trash p/u!  Activities - I really recommend this resort to all as there is plenty to do nearby. While away we did it all, we went dogsledding, snow tubing and skiing....yes I'm sore and did pay for it but you only live once!   Dogsledding was with Windrift Kennels. We did the half a day tour. I highly recommend if you're going to dogsled, do the short rides. The half a day felt like a rip off $250.00. Half of it was done on the road to get to the trail, making it difficult for the driver of the sled and the dogs. There was little snow on the road. I rode in the sled while my boyfriend drove. The dogs are strong however there are times when you need to exert yourself by pushing the sled up the hill. Riding on the trail was obviously easier. There is a session done solely on trail and I wish we would have done that instead. The trip was really only 2hours and the rest of the time was getting the dogs binded to the sled. I was disturbed by the noise the dogs made whining and howling...there were over 200 dogs on the farm. Watching the dogs get chosen and being lead to the lead was disturbing, not for kids. The dogs are so hyper and excited to go out the person has to wrangle them by the collar to get to the sled....not something I can get out of my head. I called Barried OSPCA to inquire if Windrift Kennels had any complaints and they wouldn't tell me. I asked the guide at Windrift Kennels if there were ever any concerns and was told not enough hay in or around the dog house was the only concern they've had with OSPCA through general site inspections. Would I do this again? No! Then again this is just my opinion!  Snow tubing - Horseshoe Valley - We went for the two hour pass between 7-9pm on a weekday and had a great time. We purchased our tickets through Carriage Hills at 20% off of $20.00.   Downhill Skiing - Horseshoe Resort - Carriage has/had a ski in - ski out package or you can purchase lift tickets for discount prices.   Carriage House - has a magnificent indoor/outdoor pool, an outdoor hot tub, includiing one inside, a sauna, a gym with the necessities, a pool room (cost a $1/game), arcade(pac man - loved) and race car, you can rent newly released movies for $5/movie.   Massage - they have an on site massage therapist who will come to your room...never used...although I really could have the last day there! Apparently they will come directly to your room.   Snowmobiling - saw a group of snowmobilers. I do believe they have snowmobile rentals nearby.  Restaurants - breakfast good and cheap at Loobies! No website so don't bother trying to find it. But we ate there for all three mornings and did two years ago...still great! It doesn't look like much but it really is Quaint, cozy and the service, quality of food and price is excellent. I recommend the omellets! the average price is $6.00/meal not including coffee which is pretty good. The Crazy horse Saloon was casual dining but your typical - pricey! There is a decent grocery store off horsehoe rd foodland! It has pre-cooked chickens and a deli bar who are willing to make fresh sandwiches!",5,positive

We choose Carriage Hills for the indoor/outdoor pool. It was a huge success!! We loved swimming outside in warm water, while our hair froze. The units we had were terrific. The one bedroom units were so spacious that one could feel like one was at home. The beds are comfortable, the units are spotlessly clean. I loved everything about Carriage Hills, but mostly the pool. It was what set the resort apart from its competition. The only complaint I would have is that the units were not ready at the check in time. There was a problem with one of the units that required our group being moved. But the staff at the front desk was awesome. I must say that customer service is a real strength for Carriage Hills. I would definitely recommend Carriage Hills to anyone and we will definitely be going back ourselves.  Hint, if you are renting a suite instead of a one or two bedroom unit, be sure to ask for one of the newer ones as they are larger and have a table, rather than trays for eating.",5,positive
57041289,barrie/ca/154980/260333/57041289.html,Carriage Hills Resort,"My parents booked this trip through RCI time share program to get the whole family together so we booked 2 2 bedroom units. At first it seemed nice, the building is attractive from the outside, we got int he room and though obviously a bit dated with brass accents, tile counters and decor it was a good layout and comfortable atmosphere with plenty of natural light. Biggest shock was no flat screen TV's in the living rooms and bedrooms. I have stayed in probably 40 hotels in the last 3 years in canada, US, and across europe and even the cheap ones are all updated to flat screens by now. The jaquizzi is probably the best feature for those that are looking for that.  All in all it was a good stay, until the first sleep. All I can say is bring your own pillows, they are the worst! Actually bring an entire bedding set, the sheets can't be more then 150 thread count, I have rug burn on my whole body from the sheets (especially with the dry winter weather), the pillows feel like they are stuffed with road kill they are so lumpy and inconsistant, I called to have them send softer piellows but the same ones came. The bedspread in that old retro material and print. All in all I can honestly say this ruined a good chunk of the vation because I could not get a good nights sleep at all.  Good skiing, dog sledding, and pool though. And stop by silks for some food, very good!",2,negative

The staff was helpful with questions we had throughout the week.  We had requested a top floor unit six weeks before our arrival and that request was honored. Norfolk was a nice quiet building with a great view of the golf course.   I was surprised that there weren't any baking sheets, pizza pans, etc in the kitchen. It was explained that most guests don't use those items so they keep a supply in the carriage house if you want to check them out for the duration of your stay. We did fine without them although I would have used the sheets instead of the broiler pan.  The unit was a nice size and had good sunlight in the livingroom and bedroom. We made use of the free internet connection and appreciated that complimentary service. Not many of the time shares that we have been to offer that.  There is a lot to do in the area, especially if you bring your bikes. Most of the terrain is pretty level so it makes for enjoyable riding without much effort.  Although we didn't swim, the pool looked inviting and was well used- being both indoor and outdoor. We did play shuffleboard several times throughout the week.

Although the resort is well off the beaten path, it is worth the drive. The resort is in an area called Horseshoe Valley and unless you plan on sitting by the pool or taking long nature walks and bike rides, you will need a car. This is a real country! It is a beautiful location with charm and tranquility. You must drive to all the attractions, but that is OK.   The resort is nestled in a private community, but it is quiet and peaceful. There is a large pool and various walking trails. A good portion of the resort is surrounded by woods, but you never feel isolated by the woods. The resort consist of large buildings which house at least 6 units each. The 2 bedroom units have 2 balcony's (the rear balcony runs along the back of the building so really all units can connect from the back. There are also stairs leading down). Some of the buildings could use some minor repairs as they all have wood trim, but it was only superficial repairs.   The units were large and comfortable and very, very clean. Dishwashing detergent and laundry soap were also provided in the rooms. We stayed in a 2 bedroom unit which was really different. The unit is split in two with a common door entrance that then has two additional doors. One leading into the large 1 bedroom apartment unit which has a full kitchen, dinning room, living room and master suite. The other 1 bedroom unit has a bedroom/living area with a small kitchen and bath room. This was a great set up if traveling with older kids or grandparents. We kept both doors open, choosing to close only the main entrance door, and we were still able to do our ""own thing"".   Niagara Falls was about a 2 1/2 hour drive, so we stayed in the ""city"" for two days. It was wonderful going back to Horseshoe Valley after the busy Niagara Falls area. There is also Saint Maries of the Huron - very educational and beautiful. The wonderful country side made for enjoyable late afternoon drives. There is a great homestyle restaurant in the area called ""Loobies"". It has wonderful food and great service. We got to know almost all the staff, including the owner. They were all so friendly.

Spent as little time as possible in the room and did not use any of the services due to how we were treated.  A Day's Inn with Four Points Pricing.

It would appear as new management changed the meals without updating the literature. None of the new offering would cause me to favor eating in so to speak. Of special note, was that there are wooded trail areas within walking distance of the hotel and as we were traveling with out two German Shepards that was quite convenient. There are other trails within a short distance that are longer but the nearly trails provide about an hour of walking.   Rooms where as expected from a chain hotel, staff was pleasant. Also of note was the older style movie house in downtown Barrie which a short drive from hotel.   I would recommend this hotel for those with pets.

376282702,barrie/ca/154980/286699/376282702.html,Four Points By Sheraton Barrie,"Stayed here for 1-night over Victoria Day weekend.  The hotel seemed empty for a long weekend, as there were only 5-8 cars in the parking lot.  The lobby had a modern design, yet cozy feel to it which was nice.  We got a room on the first floor. I think the hotel was just renovated, so it was very clean and spacious. So far so good.  We used their swimming pool/whirlpool. It was a decent size and very clean.   Now, the reason for the 2/5 review is due to their poor soundproof walls, and malfunctioning fridge in our room.  At night time, we could hear people and kids talking while walking in the hallway very clearly. This was never an issue at many other hotels I stayed at previously.  There was also an ice machine by our unit and it would wake me up everytime someone is getting the ice. (not sure why people would get ice at 3am). Very noisy. Making things worse, our fridge in the room was making a vibrating noise on and off throughout the night.  I barely got any sleep during this visit, and was exhausted the following day on our Anniversary trip.  Someone else mentioned this too, but we could also hear people upstairs as well.  I think it was the maids cleaning the unit in the morning.   When we were checking out, we told the front desk about the issue, and all they said was they will get maintenance people to fix the fridge. I guess there's not much they could do at that point.  This was suppose to be a relaxing weekend, but instead, I was stressed and tired.  I'm not sure if we were just placed in the wrong unit, but at this point, I would not stay at this hotel again.

No troubles at all... I wish I could have stayed longer. The staff was friendly, helpful and genuine. The rooms were clean, modern and spacious. The area itself was easy to get to and there was a Tim's up the road.  The decor in the main entrance was unique and felt swanky compared your typical 3 floor hotel. Needless to say, the elevator was never busy and the stairs were close by for quick runs to and from the room.  The highlight of my business trip was the exceptional service from the two bartenders at the hotel restaurant. They made me feel at home and managed to maintain exceptional service while operating room service at the same time. The beer was on draft from the local brewery, Flying Monkey, and the price was fair.

We stayed in a double queen room and it was easily spacious enough for both of us. We appreciated the mini fridge.  The hotel was well appointed and modern. The exercise room had a fair number of machines (for a small hotel) and I very much appreciated the virtual reality feature on the treadmill that created the experience of hiking through various famous trails (grand canyon, etc.) We did not use the pool or jacuzzi during this stay.  We wished the hotel offered an outdoor sitting area for guests to relax in, as the weather was beautiful and we would have loved to have had the chance to sit outside and enjoy the late afternoon sun (after the conference ended). A few comfortable chairs on a small patio would have been all that was needed to have greatly increased the quality and comfort of our stay.  The bed was comfortable and the room and bathroom was extremely clean. I was surprised that the air conditioner was an old style 'wall unit' and the cold air from the unit blasted out to create a freezing temperature - a moderate temperature did not seem obtainable. It was either freezing cold or we had to turn it off and suffer in the heat. The poor air conditioning and the lack of outdoor seating is the reason for my 3 star review, rather than 4 stars.

The pool was gross, it was not clean there were clumps of unknown stuff floating around, hair balls and it had a greasy film over the top. There was rust running around anything metal, the floor of the pool was peeling. So the pool looks like it is about 15 years old and has never been cleaned or maintained.

But if you need a good night's sleep then you should look elsewhere. The rooms and bathrooms are nice and clean enough for a 3 start hotel, but the first room they showed us was a connecting room. You would think that the people in the neighbouring room were inside our room. So loud. We asked to switch to a non-connecting room which they happily and very promptly did. Nice customer service. HOWEVER when we returned from dinner to our room, imagine our surprise when we saw two guys standing outside our room, trying their key in OUR ROOM, and getting INTO OUR ROOM with perfectly functioning keys. Luckily we happened to be right there. Apparently there was a ""glitch"" in the system. But seriously... the hotel is tiny, how can you get confused where there are less than 100 rooms in a hotel? Once again great customer service, a lot of apologizing and proactive replacement of our keys. Thank you.  Then we tried to get some sleep. This time the people in our neighbouring room were talking & laughing so loudly. Eventually it was just too late and there was no end to the festivities. At 1:00 am I called the front desk to ask them to quiet down the neighbours, which they did, thankfully. The walls are PAPER THIN. You can hear everything. You can hear the toilet flushing next door. You can hear the shower turning on. You can hear everything. It's brutal. Then the same thing happened at 6am this morning. People talking loudly in the hallways, next door, you hear everything everywhere. It was awful. I am never staying here again and recommend that the hotel install insulation because people actually want to sleep sometimes.

Nice big shower with 3 pumps for body wash, shampoo and conditioner instead of those crappy little bottles. I have never seen this and although it's something simple, it made life so much easier especially after a wedding with a bottle of hairspray in my hair.

My husband and I stayed there for 6 nights in July 2006. We got a king suite so that we would have room to do some business - we were on a house-hunting trip but the room was smaller than we expected. By night six I called down to the front desk to make it known that the carpets had not been vacuumed once during our stay (and previous to that??) nor had the bathroom floor been cleaned very well. There were numerous other problems: the ice bucket was cleaned out about every second day; supplies were replenished on a hit-and-miss basis; the fridge leaked, and the tub drained slowly. Making the front desk aware of the latter one evening we were told to come back down in the morning and put in a request with housekeeping/maintenance at that time. Why couldn't they make a note of it and take care of putting the request in at that time?? One day we returned to the duvet and duvet cover, separated, sitting on the sofa. What were we to do? Make it up and return it to the bed?? The room was very dusty. I'm not suggesting it was filth like some motels you might imagine in nightmares, but for the price we were paying, and for the length of stay, we were disappointed with lack of attention to detail. We won't be staying there again or recommending it, although the towels were of good quality and the sheets were nice. We did receive one night free after our complaints were heard by a mature lady at the front desk, unlike our dealings with the very young staff for previous requests in the week.",2,negative

The bathrooms were tiny though - not much room to manoeuvre at all.   On closer inspectiion, I found both the rooms to be fairly dusty - they had certainly been cleaned, but judging by the dust on some of the surfaces in each of the bedrooms and bathrooms, it had been a while since. Carpets in the bedrooms were also dusty.  The breakfast room was tiny - not enough tables for everyone. There was a notice asking that you eat up within fifteen minutes, and you could not take a tray to the bedrooms even if the breakfast room was full.   Overall, the hotel would have been great if the breakfast facilities had been better and the rooms had been checked before our arrival - we stayed in six hotels during our visit to Ontario, and I am sorry to say that this was the only one to which we would not return.  We enjoyed Barrie though - lovely place, especially around the marina and beach, and wonderful Fancy's Fish and Chips.",3,negative
3529781,barrie/ca/154980/292532/10437456.html,Holiday Inn Express Barrie,"I have just returned from a business trip to Barrie. We visit Barrie at least once a year and try to check out different hotels and find the best one. We were not sure about the Holiday Inn Express, as it was an Express, without a restaurant / bar on site, etc. However, we were pleasantly surprised and I would recommend this hotel to anybody.  Its location is excellent even though it is on the outskirts of Barrie. Right across the street, there is a Wal-Mart, Winners, Bagel place, Second Cup, Canadian Tire, Beer Store, LCBO, a bank, numerous restaurants, etc; you name it - it's there. The hotel itself is brand new, opened a year and a half ago and it shows. It's spotless, everything smells fresh. The staff were very professional and efficient, check-in was done in 2 minutes, and check-out - we just left the keys in our room. The room was exceptionally clean, everything was brand new (microwave, fridge, iron, TV had more than 30 chanels) and beds were very comfortable. The bathroom was very small; when closing the door, it was almost touching the toilet, but it was absolutely spotless; with the best shower I have ever seen in a hotel - the showerhead with 3 settings and the curtain rod allowed for extra room in the shower. Even though our room was right opposite the elevator, we heard no noise. The wake up call was made right on time. A message left at the front desk for our colleagues was delivered promptly.  The hotel has a very small pool facing the parking lot and a small gym with what looked like brand new equipment. They also offer complimentary breakfast, with limited food choice, as expected; we did not have time in the morning to check it out. The breakfast room looked nice though.  Of course, this is not a 5 star hotel, but it's spotless, well run, everything is new, staff are very helpful and it is surrounded by numerous stores and restaurants. The only problem we've encountered was that they would not guarantee a non-smoking room; which is a little hard to understand as we were told that 75% of the hotel rooms were non-smoking. Prior to checking-in, we had been a little worried that we would end up in a smoking room; however everybody did get a non-smoking room.   We spent only one night at this hotel, but I would warmly recommend it to travellers. Keep up the good work Holiday Inn Express!",5,positive

They were good at getting us relocated to another room but it was after a long day already. Not the cleanest hotel i have been in for the money for sure. Getting back onto Hwy 400 is always a treat from this end of town as Barrie itself is not really set up to be driver friendly.  Check in staff and Peter on night staff were fantastic but their cleaning staff have ALOT to be desired. Temperature control is tough, the rooms were so hot we ended up running A/C on full on the 28th of December. Sons g/f would not walk in the hallway after running into an intoxicated guest wondering the hallways. Bathroom is dated and run down and the mattress has seen better days as it was very cupped to the middle. Pool looked good and we did not try the breakfast The one good thing about it was there was not a lot of hallway noise or outside noice. Lots of kids but none running the hallways which is great of the parents.

I had seen this hotel from the outside and thought it would be an okay place to stay and a better alternative to a smoking room. While the hotel is only 6 or 7 years old, it looks and feels much older in it's guest rooms. The rooms are worn out looking with small bathrooms, cracked wallpaper, and old picture tube TV's.   The first room we were assigned was on the first floor and had a definite musty, moldy smell. When bringing this to the attention of the front desk we were offered a room that was on a higher floor. There was no smell in this room, but again, just a general feeling of being worn out and outdated. At a higher price than some other hotels in the area this was a disappointment and not evident at all from the outside of the building.  On the plus side, the complimentary breakfast in the morning was fine with hot and cold selections. The location is convenient with nice restaurants, shopping and a movie theatre in very close proximity.

126884955,barrie/ca/154980/292532/126884955.html,Holiday Inn Express Barrie,Stayed at this hotel twice in March. Rooms are not overly clean. Black marks on the tiles in the bathrooms. Dust in corners and along edges of room and furniture. Fridge had stains inside. Air conditioning/heating units are very noisy....best to leave manually leave fan on low and let air or heat cut in as necessary. Not sure how sheets are laundered but on both occassions sheets and towels had a very strong bleach odour. It's not particularly objectionable but I suspect it could cause problems for those with allergies.  Rooms are extremely quiet - even tho on the second stay we were close to the elevator and the hotel was full. Breakfast was the usual HI fare. The big difference was in the staffing of the breakfast room. On the first stay the server had her nose buried in a book and wasn't refilling empty trays. On the seocnd stay we were greeted with a cheery good morning and that alone seemed to up the quality of the food a notch.

130614684,barrie/ca/154980/292532/130614684.html,Holiday Inn Express Barrie,"I got into Barrie around 7pm, looked online and saw this hotel had a room available at $119. I went to the hotel and got a room, the manager quoted me $137. I told him about the rate I saw online 5 minutes earlier but he insisted that must have been another room type and that they don't have anything available at that rate. It was late, not worth arguing over $18, so I took the room. I went up to the room and found it left as-is from the previous guests: the bed sheets were used and hanging off the bed, moist towels on the floor and in the shower and used coffee cups on the table. This was 8pm and the room still wasn't cleaned from the previous night! I went back down to the lobby (in the worlds slowest elevator). The girl at the counter said ""hmm I dont know how that happened"" and gave me a new room...but offered no apology. I went to my new room and the hallways had become the after party for a kids hockey tournament. They all had their room doors propped open running from room to room. I didn't complain, it wasn't too late. I tried getting online but my access code was not working. I tried to call the front desk but the phone was broken....back down to the front desk. I got the proper access code and told her about the phone and the noise concerns. Again, no apologies just ""hmm, do you want me to see if someone can look at the phone?"". Screw it, I have a cell and wasn't going to get any work done with the noise upstairs so I went for a late dinner. I came back and all the hockey parents had elected the room adjacent to mine as their party room while the kids hung out in the hallways. There are cameras right in the hallway staring right at them, obviously the staff either doesn't look at them or doesn't care. I got online, checked the hotel's website and found the $119 rate was still available. I saw the manager and told him about the rate and he asked which website I was looking at. ""Yours"" I told him. His response....he actually just looked confused and shrugged his shoulders. The partying went on until after midnight (on a weekday) and the kids left all their garbage in the hallways (see the picture, the staff didn't bother cleaning it either).  Next morning I brought by luggage out to the truck which was parked near the back door and started it up (it was -30C). I tried to go back inside but my card had been deactivated. I walked around the building without a jacket and got my card reactivated. I will not be revisiting this hotel. My next problem is with Holiday Inn's Corp. I've never formally complained about a hotel stay but this was warranted. These people are almost as bad as the Barrie staff. I explained the problem I had and they said they were going to give me ""1000 Priority Club Points"". But I realized they never even asked me which stay I was complaining about....they just wanted to get me off the phone. I also realized later how worthless 1000 points actually are...you'd need about 15,000 for one night in this hotel. So essentially they are telling me that I'm not getting reimbursed for my terrible stay, but if I have 14 more terrible stays like that I will earn a free one! This infuriated me more. I called them back. I clearly stated that I wasn't looking for useless points or freebies and that I was offended by the 1000 points they gave me. I told them that I was just looking for some confidence that this was being taken seriously. After a pointless conversation with an operator then a supervisor I walked away with 13,000 points and even more frustration. they didn't even get into the specifics of my stay, Im sure they didn't address it with the Barrie hotel. Please look at my previous hotel and restaurant reviews. I am a senior contributor. I live on the road about a third of my time and offer very fair reviews.

These girls, along with the nice young waiter I commented on at Jack Astor's restaurant (which is also very close to this hotel), really left us with a good impression of Barrie and its people.  The hotel itself was pretty nice. We enjoyed the free breakfast (I was just a little disappointed to see that there was not a waffle maker---mind you, there is a pancake one). I was impressed how they had girls always sitting near and often cleaning the breakfast area. The pool and hot tub were also nice, although the pool was pretty small and it really wasn't that relaxing to be swimming and have everybody who was coming and going at the elevator often looking in at the people swimming (the pool and hot tub can all be seen when you go or leave the elevator through the bare windows that show the entire swimming and hot tub area).

I was impressed by the breakfast buffet, I usually pass on it but went there just before they closed @ 10:00am and found it still stocked with both hot and cold food choices.   All in all a very pleasant stay! We hope to be back next year.",5,positive

I thought the ""Express"" was a different type of Holiday Inn, but it turned out to be really fresh and clean and very quiet. So quiet I did not hear anything even though there was some wedding party of some type of group staying, I would recommend it and found the beds prefect for sleeping. (Sometimes hotels can differ from each other, but this one has really good beds). When I asked for directions around Barrie the staff were very helpful and even found me some brochures and map to help. Maybe it was a routine kind of things, but way better service..

It was a Sunday and the car repair involved waiting for a part to be delivered from Toronto the next day, so we had to stay overnight. The Holiday Inn Express on Bryne Drive was close in proximity, so we checked in once they confirmed they would welcome our two larger dogs - each weighing 72 pounds. We were given a room on the first floor that was clean and well maintained, with a fridge and microwave and two very comfortable queen size beds. The management was also kind enough to allow us to store two coolers full of frozen meat (that we were transporting south with us) in their Breakfast Room freezer overnight, thus saving the meat from spoiling before we made it home. The breakfast they offered the next morning was a nice surprise; scrambled and hard boiled eggs, bacon, toast, pancakes, muffins, pastries and fruit were all available. We didn't have a chance to use the pool or exercise room but other guests were definitely making use of these amenities. Although not a planned stop over, the staff in this hotel certainly helped make an overnight travel delay far more pleasurable and less of a headache!

There were eggs, sausages, bacon, bagels, toast, rolls and a pancake machine (much better than the messy waffle makers that some hotels have, but it would be nice if you could choose one or two pancakes.) There was a fridge there and I think that there was yogurt and hard-boiled eggs in there. There was also coffee, juice and milk to drink. Check in and out was quick and the staff were very friendly.

They referred me to the hotel on Bryne street as it is a smoke free building. I have to say, they live up to that promise and I found that our rooms were pleasant and enjoyable due to this. The bedding was clean and didn't smell like strong cleaners (usually I can't stand the scent on the pillow cases and blankets) but this was not the case - everything was fresh.   The rooms were clean... there was a tiny bit of spotting in the corner of the shower and a bit of dirt on the floor in the bathroom, but overall, it was not an issue that was a problem. Everything else was tidy and neat.  The room had a mini area with a microwave, fridge and a coffee pot... they also had very nice little soaps on the counter. The staff was helpful and cheerful (which was nice after a long drive to the hotel). The room came with one chair and a desk and it would have been nice to have a second chair that we both could have used the table at the same time.   The breakfast was fine (toast, fruit, juice and coffee) but there were options for bacon, eggs, cereal and a few other items.. It's not a five star breakfast, its just enough to get you going in the morning.....the eating area was crowded (so I took my meal upstairs to our room).. things got a bit cold as the elevator is slow.  The only problem I really had, was that the fans in the bathroom never-shut-off. So you heard the whirrrringg all through the night. The beds were comfortable enough and the blankets and pillows nice enough that it did compensate for the sound a bit, and I ended up having a nice sleep.  The location is okay - you are only a few km from getting back on the 400 and close enough to restaurants that you could plan to walk just about everywhere you needed.   For the price? It was an okay stay. It didn't break the bank and we all slept alright.",4,positive

Two queen beds, very comfortable and a decent amount of space in the room. I was pleased with how quiet the room was.The bathroom sadly was one of those bathrooms where the door barely opens as it clears the toilet by barely a millimeter - so it was very tight for space.   The front desk staff were very pleasant to deal with and the breakfast was good.   As someone with an issue with scented products, and who can get migraines from strong chemical scents, I was nearly struck down by how much of a deodorizer/carpet cleaner/strong cleaning product smell was in the hallways. I definitely found it headache inducing and it made me not want transverse the common areas of the hotel.
 
 
 Room Tip:  The two queen bed room is quite comfortable.

250763385,barrie/ca/154980/292532/250763385.html,Holiday Inn Express Barrie,"I stayed here on the 23 of January with plans to stay another night.   Overall the room was spacious, clean and the bed was comfortable.   The hotel is close to the highway and a handful of restaurants. There is a lot of traffic during the day ( but that is just barrie haha).   The downfall for me was the noise. Upon check in, I was told I was on the second floor and their should not be many kids. That alerted me to the fact that they were probably used to noise complaints. What I did not realize is that the room was right across from the elevator and directly above the pool. The walls are thin and there were kids yelling up and down the hall until 11pm. The noise from the pool carried on until about 10pm. If you are unfortunate enough to be on the side of the hotel adjacent to the ford dealership, there are also obnoxiously bright street lamp style (flood lights) directly outside the bedroom windows.   Overall, I think the hotel is a bit over priced. However it has a good location, clean room and comfortable beds. I'm coming from outside of Barrie so it's nice to have a hotel with complementary parking and free wifi. The breakfast in the morning had a little bit of everything. If you are staying with kids then this place may be for you. If you are alone and looking for a quiet night. Look elsewhere. I'll be staying elsewhere tonight.",3,negative

264776682,barrie/ca/154980/292532/264776682.html,Holiday Inn Express Barrie,"I stayed at this hotel with my mother on a recent overnight trip too Barrie, as we were heading further down and thought we would make a stop in Barrie for pleasure. We were greeted with your very friendly staff, and she informed us of a couple hockey teams that were staying at our hotel the same time we were, but they were mostly on the second floor, and our room was on the third. Our room was very nice. The beds and pillows were the most comfortable I have ever slept in. The wifi worked fantastically, witch was unexpected since hotel wifi usually doesn't work, but this one did and the lady and the front desk gave us the code without hesitation. Our view wasn't the best, but that was alright. The TV remote also didn't function, but we didn't use the TV very much, so it was ok too use the side panels when we did use the TV. Unfortunately, their was a hockey family staying right across from us, who couldn't take very good control of their kids. Twice, once at about 5:30 and another at about 10, a few kids came running to our door, knocked, twisted the door and ran away. We were not sleeping at the time, so this didn't necessarily bother us, just a sudden frighten when it did happen. This of course is not by any means the fault of the hotel, just the parents. However, numerous times the kids who were part of the hockey teams would play loud games that involved running in the halls, and would be very disruptive while entering their own rooms, banging on the door and yelling loud things. We did however hear the parents of the children get mad at them for being disruptive. The breakfast the next morning was fantastic. A lot more fancy then what we were expecting. This included fresh hot pancakes, cereal, oatmeal packages, different types of bread, hot cinnamon buns, various types of fruit, sausage, eggs, bacon, yogurt, cold and warm beverage choices, and an entire tea and coffee station. The breakfast room was very cute too. We did not eat in their, however the sight of it was very pleasant. We went down to get our food at about 7, and their were very few people in the room at the same time. We left around 9:30 and the room was packed with hockey family's. Over all we enjoyed our stay and would defiantly stay at this hotel again. I recommend it.",4,positive

I don't blame them for complaining but had they been down the hall they would not have heard anything. I understand the staff's responsibilities to respond but they were very rude to us.

The room was modern, clean and breakfast was nice.   A couple of things to note:  Breakfast doesn't start till 6:30 so I had five minutes to grab something for the road which made breakfast less enjoyable.   I wanted to pay cash for my room and had the cash in hand when I checked in. The attendant informed me they didn't take cash (??) and then said that I would need to put the room fee and deposit on my visa and I could pay cash in the morning (after my incredulous look). I did so and the next morning when I checked out I settled up cash. What I didn't know was that the $250+ hold on my visa would be there for 'a few business days'. !?! May not be an issue for some but I was purchasing a large overseas trip that day and had to scramble with bank accounts. This was the whole reason I wanted to pay cash to begin with.   I called the hotel and although she was polite, the attendant seemed less than sympathetic. I have stayed at hotels before and done this but this is the first one I have stayed at that held my money for more than one day. I was disappointed in the less than transparent way that the hotel dealt with my money. Essentially for 'a few days' this hotel cost me $450/night.

Our original hotel that we booked with was a nightmare, the only good thing from that was the front desk clerk, who was very professional and polite and in my opinion deserves to be recognized as a valuable employee. That being said, once we walked in through the doors of the Holiday Inn Express, which was not our original choice, we were greeted with such warmth and big smiles that it made my family and I feel as if we were at home. I am very picky when it comes to hotels, and hotel cleanliness, and this hotel delivers on levels! The staff, from the front desk to the house keeping department, are all super and deserve hats off for such excellent service they offer and how they welcome guests into their hotel! The hotel grounds are clean, the rooms are clean, the hotel facilities are clean, this truly is very important!!! Breakfast area offers a variety of choice with flexible hours and there is always free coffee available in the lobby...coffee was really good!! Overall, to ask for a better place to stay with a family, we could not ask for more. Very well located and in walking distance to most everything! The kids enjoyed their stay as well we did too!!! A clean and safe hotel, excellent staff, and great location, what more can one ask for.

I noticed right away a problem with the toilet in our room not flushing right. I pretty much had to beg for a plunger and was told by staff ""it's a low flow toilet that's how they work"". Ok first off, I own my own home with two low flush toilets, second off I am not an idiot. I knew something was wrong. Well by the next morning you can imagine what happened next. Good thing I begged for that plunger. I left a note for the cleaner and they were calling a plumber that night. After waiting a couple hours while the toilet was completely off its base and lying on its side we decided to request a new room which we were provided without incident. The staff this time were very accommodating. Apparently having the plumber there for hours on end they now believed the toilet had a problem.  Aside from the toilet issue the hotel was pretty good. Comfy rooms, comfy beds, a nice pool and hot tub, standard Holiday Inn breakfast in the morning. Overall an ok stay.",4,positive

Three weeks later, I was in Barrie again and learned some new things about this hotel. To me, the measure of a good hotel is when it is at its capacity. This was the case with my second stay. The hotel was full and it simply cannot handle this. The noise was unbelievable, the wait for the elevator was unreasonable, you could not move in the breakfast room, and the pool was overcrowded (probably unsafe). Staff were definitely harried and the friendliness I encountered the first time was missing....for good reason, I would say as they were very likely understaffed. I would not stay here again unless certain that they were well under capacity.",3,negative
65859741,barrie/ca/154980/292532/65859741.html,Holiday Inn Express Barrie,"We Booked a nights stay at this hotel due to an unusual overbooking situation for hotels in the Orillia area, and in doing so were treated to a very welcom suprise.  Our trip was not really about visiting Orillia or Barrie, but rather we had gone up to visit with family for the day and it is nice not to have to drive home after.   We arrived after 8:00 PM having previously reserving a suite. We had a little trepidation upon arrival seeing that the lengh of the hotel runs up a small incline and that the ground floor suites are in plain view to people walking by the window. We had that sinking feeling of You Know were gonna get one of those suites for arriving here at 8:00PM, and sure enough we did, and you know what they are actually pretty awesome.  We stayed in suite 113 which is on the parking lot side of the hotel and is about 1/2 of the way down the main 1st floor hallway. It is a Traditional 2 Queen Suite. Upon entering we first noticed that the ceiling on these ground floo rooms is a colossal 10 ro 12 feet, but once you settle in you forget how cavernous it is and if you don't look up you don't even think about the scale. The windows also have sun blocking and view blocking privacy curtains which we closed 5 minutes after entering.  The suite was not too large but there was enogh spacing between and beside the beds and at the window end there is a writeing desk with a swivel chair as well an easy chair. When you first walki in their is a small counter and shelf area with a coffee maker, a microwave and a good size bar fridge. This is also where the ice bucket is located.  The bathroom to be honest felt cramped,, you either have to use it with the door closed or open, if someone is err, um occupided on the throne and someone else were to open the door to come in and wash up or use the mirror for applying make up etc. then the person on the throne would have to get their knees banged. There really is no way to fully open the bathroom door, or close it if someone is sitting there. Other than that the bahroom has an awsome comfortatble and quiet low flow toelet , single vanity counter running the length of the room and accross from that the shower with the curved shower curtain bar and the pressure is quite nice.  The TV is a traditional big Bulky CRT model but swivels nicely on a little tray that slides out a bit and is watchable from either bed. I would say that it was around 27 or 30 inches. It includes about 50 or 60 basc cable chanels as well as Movies, Adult Movies and Music on Demand for an additonal fee.Upon reading the guide to service in the room we found that one could call up and have the Adult content blocked until 12pm the following day on a day per day basis for your stay. Good for parents who want to avoid that right up front. The reception was good, and the Remote has a sleep function, as does the clock radio.  We swam, and found the pool refreshing, heated but not to hot, clorinated but not so much that it stung, the hot tub not to hot that it made your red. The only thing I would say is that it is a wee bit small, the whirlpool takes up 1./2 of the shallow end and the other half is the stair to get out. The deep end is only 5 feet and you can swim across it in about 10 strokes maximum. I know it looks smal in the pictures but it is actually even smaller when you are in it. That being said this is really first and foremost a travellers hotel and having a pool is a big plus, the families with younger kids certainily seemed to get good us out of it. For us it was just nice to be able to get wet and chill for a little bit.  There is a snack macihine in the pool lobby and we thought that it was cool that they sell boxes of condoms from it as well as pain killers. The hotel really caters to the tiered traveller who does not want to jump in the car and look for a drug store just because they forgot something. We read that we could get complimentary tolietries if we had forgot any.  If you need to pop online to check an email or get some sort of info the small single chaired business centre just off of the front desk is great and fairly private since you need to use your room key and there is just hte one computer, but still a big plus. We don't have a lap top but we did see the high speed ethernet port in our room, so you could also access the net there.  The beds were awesome and pillows are ample fromt he get go, we had 8 in total between the 2 beds and there are 4 soft and 4 firm pillows matched to pillow cases embroidered with SOFT and FIRM on the opening of the pillow casing.   Breakfast EPRESS is the real gem of the hotel, we have had some really abismal hotel breatkfasts in the past, but every thing shined here:  COFFEE wit TO GO LIDS ORANGE, APPLE and at least one other JUICE dispenser Fresh Fruit Bread, Bagles, Crossaints and EGGO Wafffles to toast with jams and cream cheese Danishes and Muffins Scrambled Eggs, Sausage Paddies, Bcaon strips in a heatedt tray Warmed Ciinomen buns A ceral assortment A fridge with 100ML yogarts, peeled hard boil eggs, full 250ML cartons of milk.  We were quite impressed, we had even bought milk at the 24 Walmart that is located in besied the Highway and only a 1 or 2 minute drive from the Hotel assuming from experience elsewhere that we may not find MILK on the menu in the breakfast nook and we wanted milk in our morning coffee.  I would recomend this hotel to weary travelers on thre raod who need to stay somewhere for the night and have the same expectations as us in levels of cleanliness, availabity if needed of addtional amentities such as a swin, a little jog, checking up someting on the net and not actaully ventruing into the city centre of Barried in ary way. It's location is very convienient to all of the BIG box style stores you find pretty much in any built up urban area.  All in All big recomend.

But my engineer husband pointed out that that they had not indicated fire exits correctly and there was no emergency exit information. However there was information on what to do in a lockdown situation!

Called downstairs, and brought the bug downstairs to show them and they sent up clean sheets, laid down again and as I was reading saw another bug at the corner of my eye, lifted my pillow and about a dozen more were there. Called downstairs again this time they changed our rooms in the middle of the night BUT put us on the same floor. The manager came to see the next day and practically accused us of bringing the bugs in with US! She told us we had to wait for some inspector to come and check that room only later to find out they had no idea when the inspector was coming. After some research online we discovered it was bed bugs, we went through every stitch of clothing, wiped everything we had with us. So no sleep for any of us that night. End up leaving our luggage and put our clothes in garbage bags and had sent them to a laundry place to have them washed and dried in hot temperatures. Checked into a new hotel, bought new luggage ($50 ea), paid for laundry ($30 ea).

I was glad to have read previous reviews to be prepared to bring utensils etc. Customer service was good. Due to constuction we got turned around entering the site. A phone call gave us friendly and accurate directions. The front desk staff answered all our questions politely through out our stay. On the down side. The room had not been cleaned well upon our arrival. There were clean sheets and towels, but the cupboards contained open food stuffs left from a previous guest, and there were wrappers etc. on the floor. Worst of all was a damp towel and pair of shorts left behind in a drawer. They must have been there for quite some time as they REEKED. Mildew had really moved in. Removing them from the drawer made the whole suite smell. :( That was but a blip. We went into this stay prepared and would stay again. The price is right.

Loved having the option to use laundry services, common kitchens to cook, free parking and Internet, as well as each suite had two bedrooms and kitchen area.   The access cards were programmed for two separate bedrooms, each room with its own card pass. The rooms had huge closets with built in storage racks, a small tv and AC controls. It is wired Internet but they provide cable connect in room. The beds are firm, but nothing fancy. Windows open for fresh air.   The bathroom had a stand up shower only but storage room under the sink for towels and toiletries. Extra towel bundles can be picked up at the front desk   Each kitchen had a full size fridge, microwave and sink. You need to bring your own utensils, cooking supplies, dish soap etc as the cupboards are bare. :). The dining room has two chair and a table suitable for all meals.   For a place to crash for 4 days during a busy wedding weekend and visit this was perfect. It was clean, quiet, comfortable, and affordable. Just remember to bring your 'luxuries'. At $69 a night, you can afford to.",4,positive

We stayed for 2 nights  Location is great as it is right off the highway.  I feel like I am back to University life as it looks exactly like a dorm room. The room is only $79/night/room which is a very good price. It comes with a fridge and a sink. cleaning service, towels are included as well.  Check in is fairly simple with free parking.  The bed is surprisingly comfortable for myself and my wife. A/C is strong.  If you have kid, there is a nice basketball court, field hockey ring and beach volleyball court. So there is quite a few outdoor activities you are do.   One last thing, They have free coffee and tea from 7 - 11am in the lobbey.

I recommend you bring your own of everything and bath towels are no bigger than dish clothes. not bad for under 100 bucks a night.

However, there is no wifi in the Rooms, and there was none in our Meeting Room. Although there was wiring for Laptops. The other thing which was somewhat disappointing was that the Kitchenette did not even have a cutlery, kettle, nor any other of the expected things save for a fridge and microwave.   However, the Staff were friendly, lots of smiles, and very helpful and accommodating.   So, for value based on the price I'd give it a 7 out of 10 and yes, I'd gladly stay there again.

We aren't sure if we got penalized for sleeping in and maid service withheld, or whether they only come in at the end of the stay, but in any event the tiny garbage can in the bathroom (the only garbage can there) was overflowing after a two night stay, to the point that we just left additional garbage on the counter. And of course it being a cheap dorm-style place there are the other guests - a rowdy basketball team on our floor and a hallway strewn with beer bottles and a corresponding smell. At least the coaches (or security) had them quiet down around midnight. In a nutshell - if you're renting out empty dorm rooms, have the decency to say so in your material.",1,negative

My roomie said her bed smelled like urine and when I went to wash my face the towel reeked of sulfur I just threw it on the ground and we ended up going to walmart to buy towels, a shower mat and shower curtain so we could put up with this place since it was to close to the festival for us to find another hotel to move to. Also the toilet runs all the time so if your a light sleeper beware! Also no curtains and the blinds dont fully close in one room and we face the parking lot so night or day there are always lights flooding the room making it hard to get a good nights rest!

Good: Breakfast had good variety and staff replenished food quickly. There was a room with stoves that guests could use. There was also a laundry room. Housekeeper was friendly and helpful. Main reason we booked this room was because it was close to the hospital (less than 5 minute walk through parking lot) so we could visit a family member. Staff was understanding of our situation when we had to check out days earlier than planned. We booked and paid for 5 nights, 6 days but could only stay for 2 nights, 3 days due to a death in the family. They gave us our money back for the remaining nights and days we could not stay.  Bad: The room smelled musty. The pillows and bed smelled like puke and one of the pillows had a stain on it. Staff lectured another staff member for being late in front of guests at breakfast. That conversation should have been had in the supply room away from guests. Stoves on floor stunk up hall and surrounding rooms. Our room was down the hall and around the corner from the stove room and we could still smell all the different foods cooked in there. Large bugs appeared in the bathroom. We had to use the free facial wash bar they gave in the bathroom as hand soap because they did not provide a small hand soap or body wash bar or bottle. We purposely stayed out of the room for hours to allow housekeeping to come but they did not come until after 4pm and we were on the first floor. I've stayed at a college residence before that offered free wi-fi for guests so keep in mind that they do only offer wi-fi in the lobby. If you do not want to sit at the desk to use their ethernet cable, be sure to bring an internet stick. Staff should have intervened when kids on our floor (first floor not far from the lobby) were running around and yelling multiple days in a row at 6-7am.

I think my biggest complaint was that we had gone out to our vehicle on the Thurs night and each grabbed an extra blanket we had (as we are use to being warm at night) and we both had our own pillows. We were there for a softball Provincial tourney so important to be comfortable. In the morning we both folded our extra blanket and left on bottom of bed. We did leave our pillow on the bed. Upon arriving back we BOTH had notices on our bed that they would not do housekeeping/change sheets in our room as we had our own stuff on the bed which would not allow them to do their job. C'mon, we never go anywhere without our pillows to ANY hotel, Canada or US and have never had an issue. The blankets were folded and out of the way (although sitting on bed) I was not overly impressed. We ended up leaving a day earlier (not necessarily because of this but I did not complain at the time as it didn't matter, we were headed home early) I thought this was a DUMB policy!",3,negative

We met other families staying in larger suites with one and two bedroom suites, some with hot tubs. A larger suite would be better for a bigger group or a longer stay.   The Ridge Club has an indoor pool and hot tub, both of which were nice. It also rents movies and board games, and has a small arcade.   The downhill ski access to Horseshoe Valley is excellent; only a short walk is required to the ski hill. Once down the hill, we purchased passes using our VIP card at a 20% discount. However, we were even more impressed with the cross-country ski area, which we hadn't heard much about previously. It has a excellent rental facility, a waxing room and a good selection of trails of varying difficulty. It also provides a 20% discount to Carriage Ridge guests.   I highly recommend this resort and will certainly return.",5,positive

The condo looked new and was super well-equipped: all you need in kitchen, bathroom had soaps/shampoo/conditionner, Tide for washer. Housekeeping even replenished all the soaps during Thursday's mid-week free clean-up. All I used of my own was Fleecy sheets for the clothes' dryer. This resort is very isolated for a summer holiday so having a car is essential. There is so much to do within 30 minutes of driving. We did: Wasaga Beach, King's Wharf Theatre in Penetanguishene, Casino Rama in Orillia for gambling and shows, Oro-Medonte and North Simcoe Bike trails on old CN rail lines. We had brought our own bikes. Other activities could be mountain biking (there was a 3rd party rental company on-site), Barrie Waterfront, golf, etc. Note that the resort does not offer a concierge desk to assist in planning your day. Their scheduled activities are mainly geared to kids (face-painting, bracelet making, horseshoe tournament). In Craighurst, ~ 5 kms away, on Horseshoe Valley Road, there is a well-stocked Foodland for groceries. The store is also a LCBO and will satisfy your alcohol requirements. The resort offers internet for $5 / 30 minutes and nice propane BBQs under pavilions. This resort offers ""ski out, ski in"" to the downhill slopes of Horseshoe Valley in the winter.",5,positive

We booked this back in January as we realized places in the area would fill up soon. My parents live 6 miles away...we liked staying here much better LOL. My kids were so excited as we entered the spotless one bedroom unit. It was beautifully decorated with warm colours and comfortable furniture. I have a tough time sleeping in other beds and I had no problems sleeping here. It was quiet despite the excitment of the race. The resort adheres to a no-noise policy after 11 PM which was fantastic. We had a lovely private deck out back overlooking the hills of the ski resort and the laundry was awesome. I was glad to be able to wash my clothes from the race! The units were very soundproof which was nice. The kids loved the t.V and the jacuzzi tub. My husband loved the gigantic shower which had the right water pressure. The full kitchen had eveything you would need to prepare a meal. We stayed for 4 days and there are limited restaurants around the area but we were more than happy to go up the road to the well-stocked Foodland in Craighurst. They have a great family style restaurant as well names Loobies. CArridge Ridge has a great park for the kids and the pool complex is so clean and wonderful with the large pool, hot tub and the kiddie pool. We loved being able to check-out board games to bring back to the unit. We would stay here again and infact have already booked for a night in August and 2 more in October.

After a long drive to reach carriage hills the location of which is poorly marked by road we were dismayed that we could not check in to our room until 4 PM. The room itself was clean but the sheets were a bit dated. The fitness area left much to be desired as most of the few pieces of equipment were hardly functioning. The resort has a small pool and a hot tub the size was not adequate given the size of the resort (very crowded) lots of kids and noise!! If you plan on having a drink in your room make sure to being your own ice cube tray as there are no ice machines. To my surprise you have to walk down to the front desk and buy ice!

Its a great place for someone who wants a condo style room with a full kitchen (we cooked almost all our meals). We stayed in a one bedroom suite and my 1.5 yr old son had plenty of room to run around inside. You need a vehicle if you stay here since it is somewhat isolated, despite the fact it is surrounded by large private homes.  I suppose the idea for these type of accommodations is that you use the Carriage Ridge as a base camp, for sleeping and meals, and then you drive to all the various places of interest around you - Barrie, Orillia, Wasaga Beach, Casinorama, and golf courses everywhere. Of course there is the ski hill right beside the hotel, so in the winter it would be great for skiing. There is no official restaurant so be prepared to drive to nearby Horseshoe resort, or into Barrie or Orillia. The place was very well run, clean and the walls were pretty thick so it was nice and quiet.

Carriage Ridge was perfect as it was next door to the facility where I was taking a BMW off road skills training course. I stayed in a 400 sq foot unit on the ground floor. It was perfect for me as I had a great deal of equipment to lug into and out of my room. There is a comfortable King bed and a bathroom with a larger shower (no tub). There were also laundry facilities share with another unit (perfect for those of us who get muddy during our daily activities with the rider training). There is a kitchen area, dining room table, and a pull out couch if one needs to have an extra bed. There was also a balcony to sit outside and enjoy the weather.  I found the staff to be friendly an attentive. My room request was fulfilled, and I was happy with how I found the unit. My only complaint is that there is no real restaurant on site. I had ride over to Horseshoe Valley or back along Horseshoe Valley road. So, if you don't mind driving for dinner or lunch for a few minutes, you will like it. I brought along food for me to keep in the units fridge so I could make some toast in the morning and have some orange juice. There is a toaster-oven in the unit that is clean and efficient. The provide plates, glasses, cutlery and even dish washing supplies.  This was the second time for me to stay here in as many months (due to the motorcycle course having two sessions).  I heartily endorse staying at the Carriage Ridge Resort, particularly if you are in the area for the BWM off road skill course at the riding adventures facility.

The location is beautiful, and all of the staff we encountered were friendly and attentive. We had dinner in a fantastic little restaurant in nearby Craighurst, called 'Abbots'. It doesn't look much from the outside but the food and service were excellent. We had breakfast at Loobie's in Craighurst opposite Abbot's which again was a good value b'fast at a nice little diner.  The one drawback of Carriage Ridge for us was the lack of dining on site. We arrived late, and left early after a short one night stay. To that end we realise that it is tailored more for families self catering on longer stays. All in all this minor point did not affect what we thought overall.

I was not expecting this to be a timeshare property but that shouldn't make too much difference. First, I was a little disappointed to realize that my bid was higher than the fall special that was being offered here at this time. I think that we should have been upgraded to above a base room as we were paying more. But the room was large and had the small kitchenette which is convenient. When we first entered the room I noticed that the top facecloth had a clear lipstick mark on it. I set it aside and didn't mention it to my partner as he would have insisted we leave immediately.  Having booked it as a hotel room I was not prepared for the fact that there was no daily room cleaning. When we came back from a day in Barrie at 4:30 and realized the room had not been cleaned and we had no towels, I called the front desk. They said that the housekeeping staff would be leaving at 5 so they would try to get some clean towels to us. Nobody came. Had I known there was no service I certainly could have planned to use the same towel, but we were not advised of it and so had left towels to be cleaned rather than be reused. There is a laundry right beside the room so we were able to wash the towels we needed, but clearly this was not what we expected to be doing on our Saturday night. (The lipstick mark on the face cloth was gone with this simple washing.) Also given no cleaning service, there was no refill of coffee for the coffeemaker so we did not have coffee for the second morning. The location was beautiful and the room was nice and private but I think that knowing that we were booked through priceline and would expect normal hotel amenities we should have had the minimum hotel type services.

Large size and the layout was great. It was clean and well kept. We really did not use any of the resort facilities other then the room itself. The kitchen was great and allowed us to make some meals, the fireplace was a welcome device to fight off the cold weather. The staff were very pleasant and helpful. There were however 2 items that I did not like. The walls are paper thin and even at this time of year doors slamming would reverberate through the building. A door slammed would vibrate the bed. A small child running around could be heard easily and we stayed on the top floor. The other thing was the shower head. It was in desperate need of repair or changing as it did not spray out but flowed more from one side. In defense of the resort I did not ask for anything to be done about the shower head so I do not know how it would have been dealt with. For the poor sound insulating construction, they would have no control over. I can only imagine what it would be like in high season.

When we finally walked into the office, the guy at the counter just looked at us and didn't say a word, we waiting a bit and then asked him if he was the one taking care of the reservations. He told us yes and took our reservation but not before making me go to the car 3 times to get different identity cards (my husband's, mine and then the vehicle registration). We had been driving for over 12 hours instead of the usual 6 hours that it should of taken so I politely asked him if we could have an extension until 11:00 AM (their check-out time is 10:00 AM) and he told me ""NO, WE ARE BOOKED"". We get to our room and we are the only car parked in the parking lot; 153 rooms = 1 car, and they were booked??? the other guests must of all walked there. As soon as we get to our room, the snow removal guys decide to start the diesel engines of their 2 trucks and let them warm up for 45 minutes just in front of our room and then they start cleaning the snow and make a mountain of snow just in front of our room again, that ended at 7:30 AM so we had to hear those trucks and see the flashing lights until that time. We finally were able to fall asleep at 8:00 AM and we had to get up at 9:00 AM to be able to be out of there by 10:00 AM.  The bed was as hard as a piece of plywood, the shower was moldy, we couldn't put up the heat in the room and it was very cold and finally they had left a dirty cleaning towel on the kitchenette counter.

Exactly at 4:00pm the lady said that they going to give us another room because our room is not ready...

You've got to be kidding??? - We came early and room not ready but told they would not process our check-in then because ""some customers stand outside their room which makes our housekeeping staff upset"" - Came back at check-in time for a 1.5 hour wait to check-in - Internet connection was terrible - so slow it would regularly lose a connection and was painful to use - 30 minutes on phone with ATT/Waypoint - I ended up using my Bell CDMA connection (at great expense). - Housekeeping staff forgot to make-up one of our bedroom completely one day - Housekeeping staff track rock salt all through the rooms and didn't even shake the rock salt off the foyer matt. I had to vacuum myself on 3 different days. - Indoor hot-tub was shut-down one day and the outdoor one was only luke warm - Phoned to find out when the Bingo was and operator couldn't tell me - transfer me to a voicemail somewhere - had to call back and ask to speak to someone who had the same yellow sheet that we were given when we checked in (but missplaced). - Another day the outdoor hot-tub was closed altogether. - Shampoo dispensers in the pool shower were empty. - When I checked out I realized that in my last call to the reservation centre when I actually booked the dates I forgot to request the Heights of Horseshoe discount, so when checking out I asked for the discount and the desk manager said ""too bad - too late - must be done at time of reservation"" (paraphrasing).

Master bath - soaker tub and separate tiolet with stand up shower. The facilities are awesome - you can use both - Carriage Ridge and Carriage Hills. One has a hot tub outside - it's incredible being outside with the snow falling, sitting in a hot steamy tub in your bathing suit - it's not as daring as you would think. There is also an outdoor/indoor pool. Both centres have kids pools and adult pools, exercise areas, arcade machines and supply towels.  Oh yah, there are laundry facilities between suites.

127612949,barrie/ca/154980/626450/127612949.html,Carriage Ridge Resort,"Staying at the resort for easter weekend, Carriage hills pool area was under renovations, so we decided to stay in the ridge because of our small children. BIG TIP: Not a good decision to stay when the hills has renovations. The ridge common area for activities is not big enough to accomodate everyone, let alone their pool area to accomodate both the Carriage ridge and hills. We decided to take our family for bingo, the activities lady was very unorganized, rushed and even swore at the fact of doing it by herself. After bingo we decided to go to the pool, another family brought food and beverages into the area, and decided it was okay to eat chips right in the hot tub. When looking at the activities there was a complementry mini massage and also Paraffin Wax treatment that you had to call ahead of time and book. Called and made resevations, went to the ridge club, the Mini massages were held in the common area right in the open while people were playing pool. Then the lady that was suppose to be there for the Paraffin Wax hand treatment never showed. That was just the activity side of things,their in room service, they only made up one of the bedrooms in the two bedroom suite. Also they leave laundry bags EVERYWHERE. I've never seen anything like that, when we asked one of the house keepers why that was left outside, she said someone should be coming by to pick them up. Same bags, still outside, have yet to be picked up. Now aside from all the negative there is a couple positives, onsite laundry, so you dont have to wait until 1pm to get towels changed you can do it yourself! Also, the bathtub.... Oh thank heavens for that!! Loved the playground area for the kids the mesh ground was very very cool, hiking paths for the few nice days we had are great!! Enjoyed our visit, we got to spend family time and at the end of the day thats all that matters! Will we be back!? Quite possibly, but for sure we will stay at the Hills resort seems more updated. I havent seen a FAT (yes I wrote fat) screen tv in like ten years LOL.

Had breakfast on the balcony and it was just simply serene. I used the gym which was very small but good. I mean who really works out during their getaways? lol. We also used the BBQ grill. Everything we needed we just had to sign out. The ladies that was in the reception desk were great! So nice, helpful, cheerful and friendly. The location is good if you're looking for a slow paced place. We live in the GTA so the hustle and bustle gets tiring. LCBO & Foodland was literally a 3 minute drive. They have activities & they suggest things you can do and see during your stay. We just wanted to stay in and relax. Enjoy the beautiful suite. We would definitely come back to Carriage Ridge Resort.

The suite is quite large, over 1,100 ft2 (100 m2) I’d say, and very well designed and maintained (from the fireplace in the living room – OK, less of an attraction this time of the year - to the Jacuzzi tub).  It’s practically one bathroom (although with two separate areas, one sink in each; a separate shower) – this could be a stretch when having 4 people in the suite.  The kitchen area is quite large, with good appliances and all the timeshare paraphernalia; everything is working! One whole week here might be too long for the two of us (not really active outdoor persons) but we’d like to return and spoil ourselves the same way on a two/three-night trip.

Also, we took a drive to Niagara Falls and stopped in Niagara on the Lake to visit some wineries and have dinner. That drive was a bit over 2 hours but well worth it.

The place was huge, with a full kitchen, a dining table, 2 other tables and modern appliances. Huge TVs in the living room and bedroom. We cooked all our own meals, so that added up to some savings.   Next time we come we will bring another couple, as the price remains the same and there is a double sofabed in the livingroom. The ensuite bathroom has a door at the living room as well as the bedroom, so both couples could use it in privacy.   One of the best things is that for very little (we think half the price of the Horseshoe Valley Resort) you have ski-in/ski-out privileges and it's close to great mountain biking and all sorts of other stuff. Would be good for kids too if we had any, as there are all kinds of activities organized by the resort.   The only negative is if you want to eat out, you have to go some distance to do so, but that's a bit of an adventure too so no biggie.

The bbq's for guest use were a draw for us, looking forward to a great bbq outside in the picnic area. There were far too few of them and after a half hour wait we finally had one for ourselves, only to find out it didn't work ( never got over 250 degrees).

We brought with us our daughter, two exchange students and my sister, so there were a lot of people to fit in, but this was not a problem. The Studio offers a huge king bed and queen pull-out sofa, its own balcony, and lots of room. The 1-BR had plenty of room, another king bed, and queen sofa in the spacious living area. Still looks quite new though it is at least 7-8 years old. Everything was clean and in good order. There is a table large enough for all six to eat at comfortably. In short, the rooms were great (as always). We generally prefer Carriage HIlls because: a) it is larger; b) it is more 'self-contained' and surrounded by greenery; and has a larger pool. At the same time, the Ridge offers a better size of Studio--where the room at Ridge is spacious, it feels a little cozier at the Hills. As always, the biggest drawback to the location is the distance from any nightlife other than at Horseshoe Resort. Barrie, Wasaga Beach and Orillia are all about 25-30 minutes drive. At the same time, this is a plus when considering day trips, especially when you throw in Blue Mountain, Collingwood, Midland and other places within 45 minutes drive.

Located 20 mins north of beautiful Barrie, Ontario the location is close to multiple ski resorts and a few golf courses. We've been going to this location for many years and have been happy overall. There are actually 2 buildings that include their sister Carriage Hills a few blocks away.   Little to really describe the facilities, you have the rooms which are very extremely large and beautifully decorated, ample free parking, outdoor BBQs and Clubhouse Pool with a few arcade games. Rooms are spread across a large area in separate 3 floor row building units (similiar to townhouses). So handicap or babies in strollers need a lower level suite as there are no elevators.  Downside is the location is difficult to find. You cannot share the pool with Carriage Hills, but you can attend all their craft events? Buildings are beginning to show wear and need of repainting or renovation. WiFi is horrible, assuming it works. BBQs all have broken starters (bring your own lighter or borrow from the clubhouse).  Excellent if you're not seeking a beautiful hotel getaway as the lack of facilities can be boring for some. The location is excellent for the skiier and great jaunt from Toronto to getaway for a few days as the rooms are very nice. Blue Mountain and Wasage Beach are unfortunately 45 mins away, but still close enough to get away from the crowds if you leave early the next morning.

We had stayed at Carriage Ridge before as part of a hockey team for a Barrie hockey tournament. Carriage Ridge offered our family of six a perfect place to relax in the evening with the space to sleep and eat in for all of us. Beautiful two bedroom accommodation with enough bathroom space for our four girls. Facilities are terrific. We will return.

139748767,barrie/ca/154980/626450/139748767.html,Carriage Ridge Resort,My husband and I arrived on September 7th for an overnight stay and to golf the next day. We arrived to our room and discovered black hair on the bathroom floor and in the shower drain...gross. I called right away and they did send someone right away but that is something that should never be missed if you care about details and return guests. We went to dinner (seperate review for that) and returned to find are entire room stinking of curry. Neighbors were cooking with it and the ventilation is not done properly in these units thus having your neighbors smell anything you are eating. Thank god I had body spray we had to spray it all through the night just to not have to smell the curry. If you are on the ground flooryou want to hope no one is above you no sound proofing here at all. We travel all over the world and have stayed at all types of places and we are not complaining people but was not impressed with our overnight stay to this resort. Too bad as we only live in Aurora and it would have been a great place to do a girls weekend with my friends but not now! I would pass on this place in the future.,3,negative

You have the choice of Carriage Hills or Carriage Ridge when booking; I booked Carriage Ridge and I am glad that I did because the pool (which is a requirement on any hotel accommodations that I make) is more central to all units. The kitchenette has all of the necessities, the room is very nice and the perk is that they provide you with laundry soap and a no-charge laundry room that is just steps from your unit. The best part was the staff; when checking in they accommodated my request of changing my unit from a ground floor to a second level; also the attendants at the ""Ridge Club"" (the pool/exercise/game building) were very helpful with information and assistance. It is very close to the Horseshoe Adventure Park which we took advantage of as well. I will definitely be returning.",4,positive

14010939,barrie/ca/154980/626450/14010939.html,Carriage Ridge Resort,"My Fiancee and I stayed at the Carriage Ridge Resort for two nights on a weekend road trip. We are a quiet couple in our early 30s. The room was lovely, well maintained and cleaned. Our first night was fine.   On our second night, after a day of heavy skiing, we decided to take it easy, so we ordered pizza to the room, watched a movie on DVD at normal volume, and went to bed around Midnight. I heard some noise coming from one of our neighbouring suites but we were tired and it wasn't enough to keep us awake.  We were woken up at 1:45am by the doorbell being rung repeatedly, and when I answered, the response came: ""Security! Open up please!"" I told the guard to wait a minute while I put on a shirt, but she continued belligerently ordering us to open the door immediately. When my fiancee answered, we were told that a noise complaint had been called in against our unit. It was obvious to the guard immediately that the caller had made a mistake, and that we hadn't caused any disturbance. When she left, we lodged an immediate complaint with the night auditor. The experience was very upsetting, and it took at least an hour for both of us to get back to sleep.   We followed up our complaint the following morning with the Management at check-out. We demanded compensation, as the minimum standard of a hotel property is a night's uninterrupted sleep, and this property's policy fails to guarantee that. I have made noise complaints against neighbours at home, and I know from experience that the police will not even knock on the door if it's quiet when they arrive. If we weren't making noise, what was to be gained from waking us up to tell us to be quiet?  The staff were completely unsympathetic. They kept saying, ""We're sorry, the security guard was just doing her job."" They offered us nothing in the way of compensation and when we said we would be writing to their parent company, Shell Vacations, to seek compensation, they welcomed us to do so. The property is physically very nice and they get 2 points for that, but I would never stay there again after this experience",2,negative

Normally my stay is 5 nights for the conference I attend in Horseshoe Valley. It is in a rural location and very quiet. The rooms are excellent - each has a small fridge and microwave. They supply utensils, plates, glasses etc. In addition to the in room mini-kitchen, there are a number of BBQ verandas around the property, with gas grills. The resort office also has extra kitchen items for use at the BBQ.  There are two types of rooms, one is a standard condo, and there is a larger suite in some units with fireplaces. I have only stayed in the standard condo rooms. There is a table and couch along with a large comfortable bed. The bathroom is large and brightly lit. A TV and DVD player are in a cabinet.  Each cluster of condo is either two or three floors high, with a small balcony. I like either a second or third story unit so I can have the window open if the weather is good. There are only stairs on the units.  They have a rec center with amusements for kids, a fitness center and a very large swimming pool - all very well kept up. There is a washer and dryer for each pair of rooms. There are two golf courses nearby - I think there is a discount for those staying at Carriage Ridge. There is a kids fun park at Horseshoe Valley, plus Winter ski slopes.  They only downside is there is no on site place to eat. About 1/2 mile to the east is a place at the golf course. Horseshoe resort down the hill (about 1.5 miles) has both a pub and upscale place. Barrie is about 15 miles to the south and has many places to eat. There is a small place or two in Craighurst - about 4 miles away, plus an IGA grocery store with an LCBO (beer, wine etc.) outlet.

Pass key did not work; it took several hours for hotel staff to respond to correct issue to give us had access to our room -- even with TWO CHILDREN.  Music from rooms on other floors so loud could not hear TV in our room nor could we speak in a normal voice from the hot tub to the adjoining bedroom. Music started at about 8 pm. We have two young teens who even commented on what kind of losers would make so much noise.  We finally became tired of not being able to hear our own TV that we called the front desk. Their response was to call them back if the noise continues after 11 pm, as they do not take action before then. Another hour passed of loud music we called back, received the same answer from the front desk. FINALLY AFTER HOUR TWO of loud music called front desk and told them we would leave if music was not turned. The front was indifferent that we were leaving. HOWEVER, when I mentioned that I was in contact with MasterCard about the charges for the room and that MasterCard would remove the room charges from my credit card, due to lack or service by Carriage Ridge staff the ""we better do something light"" went off. Within minutes the music was turned down  Upon returning home we filed a complaint with Shell, the property management company, thinking it was just the associates at the front desk not wanting to do anything. After a week the Shell returned our email and we were astonished to read that until 11 pm their policy is to do nothing, not matter how much it is disturbing to another guest.  Wifi Internet, we received better wifi reception in the parking lot than in our room!  This was our first last visit to this party place with no rules until 11 pm.

The bedroom was spacious, with a cheater ensuite and separate dressing room/jet tub room.   The unit we stayed in was located right at the top of one of the ski hills at neighbouring Horseshoe Valley resort. It was fun to ski over to our room for lunch, then get right back on the slopes and ski down the rest of the hill.   The only disadvantage to this place was the noise associated with the snow-making equipment at night. A steady stream of snowmobiles and, I presume, Bobcats with backup beeps, made it difficult to get a decent night's sleep.   If you, or the person you share a bed with, are light sleepers, I recommend getting a unit that doesn't back directly onto the hill.",4,positive

I booked a certain type of room with a group and ended up in a room type that I did not book and not even with my group. When I asked to be moved they wouldn't move me nor would they provide me with any type of compensation for giving me a substandard/not what I booked room. They simply didn't care! I will never stay here again! Problem is they don't seem to care that if you lose one customer that means you have lost multiple customers. I will tell 2 (or more) friends, and they will tell 2 friends and they will tell 2 friends and that adds up. For the condition of the place they need all the business they can get just to stay afloat. It's run down, rickety furniture, building are in a huge need of a paint job, they check you in with wet carpets, maintenance staff the come in and walk all over the carpeted floor with their shoes on, they change their rules on a whim, have lifeguards at the pool that don't watch the pool...they are too busy texting or flirting with the teenage girls (of which are way to young for him). Considering they are part of Shell Hospitality Vacations that are trying to sell units across the globe, you would think that their management would have proper training in keeping customers happy and not letting them go away upset or dissatified. They don't know the meaning of HOSPITALITY!

However, if you can just ignore this, you surely can enjoy this place. Most of the service personnel are very cool (e.g. the college kids doing the cleaning, the guys at the checkout, etc.) and quite helpful.  You can ski-out to the Horseshoe Resort.  The place has no restaurant, but there are places to eat at the resort - a short drive away.  We stayed with 5 other friends' families, and a few complained that they could not get late check-out, even though they were willing to pay the resort charges ($30+), yet I was able to get a late checkout a few hours later for my unit.  They really need to follow up on customer support complaints - e.g. put a ""suggestions"" emails.

We had a full kitchen with everything you could think you would need to cook. There was also a dining room and a living room. The bedroom was great and seperate from the living area and the jacuzzi tub was to die for! We also had access to the studio but we didn't use it at all (except to store our bikes).  The room made me feel just like if I was home because it was so neat and comfortable. The only down side was the uncomfortable couch in the living room...  There is not much to do around the resort (we were after ski but before golf season). We went and visited Collingwood, Wasaga beach, Orillia, Elmvale (maple syrup festival) and Barrie. Each town had great areas for walking and biking and some small stores to shop.  We also did a day trip to Niagara fall, Niagara on the lake and we visited 11 wineries. It was a blast! It takes 2.5 hours to go to Niagara on the lake but it was definitely worth it!  We used both pools at the Carriage Ridge and Carriage Hills. Both were clean and well maintain.  We ate at Abbott's: was okay, we were not that impressed Tara (indian restaurant in Barrie): excellent lunch buffet for 9.50$ A japanese sushi restaurant just off the Essa exit on the 400 in Barrie: was excellent, you have to like sushi! La cachette at Stern (winery in Niagara on the lake): fancy but food was excellent. Price reasonnable for lunch.  We ate in our room most of the times. They had several BBQ on site so it was great.

You actually check in at the Hills section. You can access the downhill or the cross-country chalets of the Horseshoe resort for your ski passes from either the Hills or the Ridge site. The downhill run is not a black diamond so it is fairly easy to ski down. However, the cross-country trail is 'red' and meant for expert skiers only. The entry point which is closer to Carriage Hills has a tricky downhill so be careful. Walk a bit if it looks too difficult. Once you get past this initial section then you only have to negotiate the ""homerun"" downhill portion before arriving at the cross-country chalet. We like staying in the Ridge section but the Hills section is good also. Both sections have a building with pools and video games room. You can also rent movies from there. These are good buildings to take young kids when not skiing. We initially used to book the rooms with a small kitchenette but we now pay the extra money for a room with a full kitchen, fireplace, jacuzzi, king size bed, pull-out sofa, TV, stereo and DVD player. You can also have wifi connection in the room. It is much easier to bring food to cook than to bring precooked food for the rooms with just the kitchenette. There are restaurants at the Horseshoe resort and in Craighurst (town nearby). You can also get pizza and subs delivered to your room at the resort. We have stayed at rooms at the Horseshoe resort before but we find the rooms at Carriage Ridge and Hills much better particularly if you don't want to pay the money to eat out every time. The staff are friendly and helpful and we have never had any problems with them. We always enjoy skiing and staying in this area.

Not only were the prices great, but the resort rooms looked beautiful!! For the same price you would get a regular hotel room we got a beautiful one bedroom condo. We had a living room, full kitchen, bedroom, and a huge jacuzzi tub. Our view off our balcony was beautiful. The hotel staff were all very friendly and very attentive. We stayed for 2 nights and during our stay we had calls from the front desk asking if we needed any help planning activities, and they even phoned around and found out what local attractions were open for the season.   It was a short drive into downtown Barrie and an even shorter drive to a well stocked grocery store, LCBO, and restaurants. The only downside of our vacation was that there is no restaurant located on the premises, and while we were there the casual restaurant at Horseshoe was closed and some of the close by restaurants closed pretty early because it was their off season. I would not recommend the Country House pizza delivery. We spent $35.00 for a medium pizza and 1 lb of wings and it was all inedible.   We will definitely plan on staying at the Carriage Ridge Resort again. It was a beautiful resort and we had a great stay there!",4,positive

The Carriage Ridge is very convenient and reasonably priced. We always book the smallest suite which has a full bathroom, king sized bed, kitchen with microwave, toaster oven, coffee maker, sink, dishes, cutlery, living area with sofa, coffee table & TV. What more do you need? Free wifi is included. The room is spotlessly clean. My only beef is the heating system which comes on periodically and is fairly noisy. Bring ear plugs if you are a light sleeper. Renting a suite here includes use of the club house with a a pool, hot tub, fitness room. All in all, a very good deal.",4,positive

I've stayed in the hotel for two weeks period this spring.  However, on day 6 of my stay, I've noticed around 10 spots on my arms/ledg that to me looked like a rash. That day (easter saturday) i've been taking benadryl and since it's a drowsy drug, I slept pretty much the whole day in the bed. By the evening I've counted 40-50 itchy spots and went to emergency in the nearby hostpital. When I was seen by a doctor he's diagnosed me with bed bugs bites and recommended to get out of the room immediately (which is exactly what I've done). I called the hotel and they moved me to a different room. In the morning when I went to reception, the very first thing I was asked by the was guest service person in charge is whether I have a letter from the doctor confirming the diagnosis (not, how do you feel, so sorry to hear that, is there anything we could....). I was very shocked. All Easter Sunday, i've spent moving to a different e or washing clothes after i've changed the room. Hotel management didn't even offer me help with the move or washing/drying my clothes to eliminate any bugs to be carried with me. I was then seen by another doctor in the same hospital a day later and he's also confirmed that I had beg bugs bites. After I've moved to a different room i had no more additional bites and am currently recovering from the bites.   Overall horrible experience with the guest services of the hotel and wouldn't recommend to anyone to stay there.",1,negative

158788723,barrie/ca/154980/626450/158788723.html,Carriage Ridge Resort,"Let me start by saying that my parents are long time visitors at this ""resort"". They usually stay in the full unit (large unit with 1 bedroom, and the studio). At the time of booking we were advised that they do not have any full units available so we were given two weeks instead of one, the first week in the studio, and the second week in the large unit. The weeks were a month apart.   We did not have any complaints about the studio stay, but the second week in the large unit was simply unacceptable in many regards.   Just before the second week came up we received a phone call at home from concierge asking if we would like to upgrade our room to a newly furnished/renovated unit. OF COURSE! :-)   My parents spent the first 3 nights there, and I came for the rest of the week with my girlfriend and a couple of friends.   Upon our arrival it was very clear that not only was this unit not renovated, but the furniture was so old the salvation army would turn it away. You could not sit on the couch, we had to unfold it and use the fold out bed as a couch to have some kind of comfort. The cable TV was in and out, and when it did work, it was so fuzzy you cold barely tell what you are watching. We called the front desk to have somebody come by to try and fix the TV. When the tech came by, he did not bother to take his salty, slushy, boots off when he walked all the way to the back of the unit to look at the TV, only to tell us that a rat most likely chewed on the cable, and there is nothing he can do about it.... REALLY!?   He offered to change units, but at this point, after we just finished unpacking that was the last thing we wanted to do.   What is really unnerving, and simply makes me angry is the service. We called front desk a couple of times to ask questions about dog sledding (which is located across the street) and they did not know anything about it. the only thing they could say was, call them...but they didn't even have a phone number. This is not customer service. Un-informed, disinterested, unhelpfull staff.   At checkout I told the front desk person all of the above, to which he was just blindly looking at me. All he could say was, ""I'm sorry, but if you are looking for compensation I cannot help you.""  Wait, what??? I never asked for compensation, all I wanted to do was let you know about my horrendous experience at your resort. He did not help the situation one bit. He then told me that he will look into those issues, and pretended to scribble something on a notepad. ( I saw this, it was literally a scribble).   Since then(February 2013) nobody has bothered to contact us regarding our concerns, or to explain anything.   Considering we pay such exuberant maintenance fees annually, I would like a response from the staff to explain where this money is going to. Because from what I have seen during my two weeks there, there are NO improvements or maintenance being done anywhere on the resort.   Yours truly,  Disgusted",1,negative

165762557,barrie/ca/154980/626450/165762557.html,Carriage Ridge Resort,"We were two adults and two kids (4 and 1). stayed for 1 week, booked through interval international.  After a long flight we arrived at the check-in at 5.30pm where we were given a map to our apartment, drove there and slept immediately. the next morning I was checking the documents I got from check-in found that I was put on the carriage hills rather than the carriage ridge. They are both under the same management with same check-in area but are considered different resorts. The Hills are larger and house the check-in desk while the Ridge is 5 min drive down the road and is relatively newer (built 2007) with better furneshing and newer appliances. So, I went back to the check-in desk and explained the issue they told me it's intervals mistake, called interval, interval called their management, the management apologized for their mistake and moved me to the apartment at the ridge. The whole afternoon was wasted for this locomotion. Anyway, the apartment is the exact same design as the one in Hills. It is comfortable a one bedroom with one bathroom including a jacozi and a sofa bed in the living room. The kitchen is very well equiped. During the week we had to use the air condition for some of the days and the fire place for some of the nights both were excellent. The area is somewhat isolated with only a couple of restaurants around and a pizza dilevery place. I guess it would be nice for couples or friends to stay as there are many outdoor activities for adults including barbeque areas, zipper line, hiking, horse back riding and cycling but with the exception of a small zoo in the area nothing much is there for the kids. We took them to the pool and rented movies for some of the nights. The playground outside was good. We visited Barrie, a small town south of the resort which happened to be celebrating Barrie's annual day with a outdoor activities for the kids. We were told at check-in that there is a midweek apartment cleaning and bedsheet changing but they never showed up. a day before we cheked-out I called the reception and they apologized and did the service that night. I would recomment the resort for people seeking a quite stay away from the city and who enjoy golfing and outdoor summer activities. I would come again with friends this time.

A friend is giving up her timeshare for free (only have to pay legal transfer fee of $700) so I wanted to check it out beforehand. Check-in was smooth and the welcome room was nice and modern so that was what I expected for the rooms. There are no elevators and we were on the 3rd floor and the stairs were dirty with paint flaking everywhere. We got to the rooms which were very spacious and decently clean but very outdated. We had the 1-bedroom plus studio. The resort really needs to do a major remodel upgrade. Our porch had great views but all old and rusty as if it was going to fall apart. The only facility we used onsite was the pool which had a nice hot tub. For all our meals we had to go for a drive into the little town and for more options, all the way to Barrie since there is nothing onsite. It was a nice getaway but it made me decide not to take the timeshare. I couldn't see us going back there again regularly.",3,negative

We had a studio on the third floor (no elevators and the stairways are in bad need of a paint job - hence I had low expectations). When we opened the door to our accommodations I was pleasantly surprised. The studio was spacious, and clean with a well equipped kitchenet. The pool facilities were spotless. We made use of the barbeques on site and took advantage of the free laundry facilities as well. My only disappointment was in their customer service. Check-in staff was cold and unwelcoming. Made us feel like they were doing us a favour. Thank goodness for Natasha who was the only warm and welcoming check in staff. The staff at the pool distributing the towels was cold and kept reminding us to keep our pool towels and return them at check out. Now why would we want to take 5 chlorine smelling towels back to our room for the next few days? We chose to hand them back at the end of each swim. This got us a few dirty looks from the distributor as we deposited the towels into the ""towel return"" bin.  Finally after signing off on housekeeping the first 2 days of our stay, we decided our room could use a clean. We returned to our room mid afternoon only to find it exactly as we had left it - beds unmade, towels on the floor. When we asked why we didn't get any housekeeping services we were told it was because we had signed off on it for the first 2 days so they assumed we didn't need it that day either. When we asked for at least fresh towels we were told we would get them the next morning. Thank goodness there was a helpful cleaning staff who rose to the occaision, climbed the 3 flights of stairs to our room and provided us with clean towels, quickly made the beds and wiped down the bathroom counters. Despite these minor complaints, we really enjoyed the resort, its facilities and the great value. We plan to return in the winter for a ski weekend!",4,positive

I will say the decor has never changed and it is starting to show. The check is 10 am, which I have never stayed any where that is that early. Typically it's 12pm at most hotels/resorts. So since we were travelling with family for a birthday party, we thought we would pay the extra $35 to check out later at 1:00. However, while we were all at the pool, our room keys were de-magnetized so that none of the 4 keys would work. The front desk claimed someone just didn't have it marked for our late check out. That however did not fix the fact that we all had to wait outside in our wet bathing suits with a baby until someone in our group went back down to get them recharged. We were on the top floor which is challenging when bringing up suitcases, toys, cooler etc. Beds were very uncomfortable in both rooms. New mattresses are definitely needed. However, there is a great kitchen area and laundry facilities.

It is not hard to find, despite others comments. You follow the signs to the check-in building, then they tell you how to drive to the building you'll be staying in. Check-in was quick and the young girl working was very pleasant. We stayed in a suite with a fireplace and Jacuzzi (definitely worth the money. please treat yourselves). The kitchen had everything you could possibly want: dishwasher, oven, full sized fridge, plates, cutlery, bowls, whisks. EVERYTHING. So just bring the food! Or there's a grocery store, gas station and LCBO about 5 mins away! There's a few other close little restaurants, but if you want a lot more options, take the 30 min drive to Barrie. There's a lot of restaurants that overlook the water and you can take a walk along the pier. Since you're in a different building down the road from check-in, you can just text them (they give you the number) and tell them your name and room # and that you're checking out. It's early... 10am for check-out. They charge you per half an hour you go over 10am. As for things to do... we didn't do much. But that was the point. We just wanted to relax and get away. We took nice walks along the country roads, taking in the sights of the changing leaves then enjoyed a nice swim in their club, which also has an arcade and hot tub. Beautiful place if you're looking for a small getaway. Looks like it would be great in the winter... it's got a ski lift/hill right on the property.

The rooms were great, they were very large and exceptionally clean. I am a bit of a fanatic so for me to say exceptionally clean it was. I didn't have a single complaint. The room has a great kitchenette, with fridge, microwave, etc.  Our room had a balcony with a couple chairs and table, fantastic for enjoying the night air, a few drinks and the scenery.

The boys loved it so much that they want to come back. The staff was very helpful in providing directions to the baseball diamonds and even printing a copy for me to navigate with. The view around is amazing.  We will definately come back and visit in the fall so we can drive along Horseshow Valley and just soak in the beautiful view.,5,positive

My husband spent one morning golfing - he loved the course! I spent the afternoon near the pool - loved the pool!

Although we were able to check in and our key worked, the staff hadn't cleaned the room yet. It took them about 40 minutes to do the condo. It was disappointing as we had guests with us who were considering purchasing a week. The staff was extremely apologetic but didn't offer anything in return. Even though the room was clean after the staff left, we still had an uneasy feeling about the room.

It had a beautiful fireplace, Jacuzzi and enough room and comfort for a crowd. The full kitchen, and free laundry facility in our condo was an added bonus that we very much appreciated. The only downfall was that we were not able to use the indoor / outdoor pool because it was thundering. They kids were not happy about that - but they enjoyed running around n the rain as an alterative in the large outdoor family area’s. We didn’t have time to appreciate the golfing that was included in the room price, but hope to in the future. We would definitely stay again.

I love off season travel because there was no waiting for lifts and the prices are lower. We also had fresh snow!  We mostly ate in the unit, which was large and comfortable in every way. We enjoyed the large tub and the double sinks. We also went to the hot tub and swimming pool. Since our visit was in the off season, we were the only ones in the building, other than the helpful woman that operates it.

There is only one small grocery store nearby in Craighurst so a trip to Barrie to stock up is a good idea. Keep in mind that there are no elevators so carrying groceries, equipment, coolers, etc up the stairs can be a challenge. Our rooms were renovated and had enough soap, detergent, etc. to suit us. Cleanliness was just okay as I did see dust and debris under coffee tables and behind bedside tables. We had an issue requiring maintenance and Chris came very quickly and helped us out.

I called the front desk from my cell phone and was ""disconnected"" I then called again and when somebody finally answered they informed me it was the switchboard and they could do nothing. I was to walk up to the pool rec centre and they would help me.

This year we payed 25% more than last year for the same room at the same time.

What can I say but well done to all the staff at the resort, the owners who help pay for the upkeep of the place and natural beautiful surroundings. If you want to come to a location that has everything to do with relaxation, outdoor activities, or just take in the wonderful scenery, then this is the one to book. We are here for a whole week and so far we have visited, Algonquin Park, Wasaga Beach, Orillia, Barrie, Midland and all the surrounding area. After a recommendation from a member of staff we dined at the local restaurant situated at another nearby hotel/resort. The service at the Silks restaurant at Horseshoe valley Resort nearby was excellent. The meal is discounted for timeshare residents from The Carriage Ridge and we would recommend it. The bill with a bottle of wine came to just under $90, all inclusive of taxes, for two. The pool and Jacuzzi at the Carridge Ridge is clean, large enough for families or couples who like to spread out a bit. There is a shallow pool set aside in the same area with a sun terrace outside. We have walked to the larger resort next door at Carriage Hills Resort and can see no difference apart from a larger pool and accommodation area. The rooms at our resort are ideal for living on a permanent basis for two people. There is everything you could want and even a large Jacuzzi bath in main bathroom. The mid week clean of room and furnishings was unexpected but gladly accepted. There are laundry facilities to every room situated just outside the front door which house a full size washing machine and tumble dryer. Waste recycling is encouraged and all facilities are available during the visit from the same utility room. The accommodation also includes all toiletries right down to washing powder and dishwasher detergent. I cannot fault the staff or resort in any way; they were very accommodating in every situation. The staff are friendly and always helpful. No, I have no friend or relative that works here, we just tell it like it is and we would come here again. Loacl foodstore at Craighurst , 2 mins drive away from resort has all supermarket and fresh produce, with an LCBO and beer store outlet inside. Adjacent is a Esso filling station. Tip: if you want internet in your room and out and about, log onto WWW.wayport.net and purchase a months worth of internet at $49.95 and then cancel before end of month. Otherwise it can be purchased for $9.95 per 24 hour period. I did the month because we like internet available all day evryday. Also use draytel.org for all your cheap calls on Voice over IP telephone system to keep in touch. Photos and video of resort on my website http://picasaweb.google.ca/deandhinsa. Enjoy !!

We ended up choosing Carriage Ridge Resort, booking a 2 night stay and an ATV tour.   Upon our arrival, we thought the resort was beautiful, the grounds well-maintained, and the rooms spacious. The longer we stayed however, the more we ran into problems.   - There were about 12 flies in our room when we arrived. We were in too good a mood to complain, so we got to work killing the flies with the activity schedules we were given (they came in VERY handy). After the first big slaughter, flies only trickled into the room 2-3 at a time every couple of hours. Needless to say, we became excellent fly-swatters by the end of the trip. In case others are wondering if this was an isolated incident, we overheard another couple in the Ridge Club complaining about the exact same thing.  - The television is not very well placed, our cabinet doors would not push back or tuck in all the way meaning that two people could not see it from the couch or bed. As we rented some DVD's, we solved this by moving the couch over.  - It was very difficult to get hot water, which made showering a challenge  - Our phone did not work upon arrival, we had to get the front desk to reset it.  - Every morning, the concierge calls the room to ask if you would like to attend a promotional (aka Time Share) meeting.   All of this could have been forgiven except that upon checkout (and after complaints to staff), we were charged more than what we were quoted online (additional fees that we were not aware of at the time of booking).  Overall, the ATV ride was amazing, but I was less than impressed with the hotel and would not choose them again.",2,negative

My only complaint about the room is that the TV (which is advertised as ""large"" is not) is located inside an armoire where the cabinet doors only open 90 degrees at most so you couldn't really watch TV from the bed or from the far end of the couch. The TV is not centred in front of the sofa but centred in front of the side table between the bed and the sofa. There is a DVD player available too.

With lots of snow on the ground and located close to lots of winter destinations we had a wonderful experience. Highly recommend!,5,positive

The bathrooms were more modern than the rest of the unit. The maintenance was very efficient. Our stay was comfortable till check out time. 10:00 am is check out time the maids were at our door before 10:00 and waiting outside till we left. which made the whole experience uncomfortable to say the least. We were late arriving back to our room because we were at a wedding and had to jump out of bed in the morning and leave ready or not. If they clean units at 10:00 am check in could be at least a little earlier and check out should be a little later. That would have made the whole experience a more relaxing time.

I only am giving a rating of four though instead of five, since we did have a couple ""speed bumps"".    We had a 10 night stay ( 3 nights through Carriage Ridge booking direct and then 7 nights through RCI) and checked in July 23. At check-in I was told that this type of stay is called a ""stayover"" and that I would receive a full clean on day 8 of the 10 nights. This never happened even though I called housekeeping and spoke to them two times about it as well as the front desk one time. No biggie, we were on vacation so no worries. It would have been nice though. Also, I found that for the first time ever , when first checking into our room, it wasn't very clean. It appeared clean, but when looking a little closer, it looked like our unit needed a ""deep/spring"" type cleaning. Corners needed vacuuming/dusting desperately. Furniture needs to be moved away from walls and cleaned behind. The washroom corners/edges were very dirty. Lots of hair and dust bunnies.    One other small ""speed-bump"" occurred when I asked to view a studio at Hills in phase one. I was told that there were some empty units (I asked mid-week early evening when I knew the reception area would not be busy). I wanted to simply look at the renovations that had been made in the Phase one studios since we have never stayed in these units. The Phase one studios are approximately 100 sq. ft. smaller then the phase two and three units. I simply wanted to see if the renovated units would be more appealing overall vs. the larger, but not renovated units in Phase two or three. After speaking to three different people (two in reception, one in sales), I was not able to view a unit. I was hoping for just two or three minutes to get a ""feel"" for the renovations/smaller size, but that didn't happen.  Other then these minor ""speed bumps"", our stay was great as usual. The Carriage Ridge rec centre was incredibly clean and the staff that work there are incredibly pleasant and knowledgeable about the area. The grounds are very well looked after and made for a lot of pleasant evening walks.  During our 10 night visit, we had the opportunity to spend time at Wasaga Beach, Blue Mountain Resort, Adventure Park at Horseshoe Resort, and shopping in Barrie. If you have any questions about the resort or any of our day trips, please feel free to message me and I will do my best to answer your questions.",4,positive

We stayed for three nights in a one bedroom unit. Because we were able to drive to the resort, we took lots of kitchen supplies and never had to shop.  Check-in was smooth and we got the second floor unit as requested. The grounds are well kept and the interior of the unit was very nicely cleaned and had an abundance of supplies for the kitchen and bathroom. The outside stairs are wooden, and the paint is in very bad shape, with paint chips everywhere. Also on the back of the building, the outside siding had been removed as if there was updating or repairs being done. But we never saw any signs of workmen or replacement materials around while we were there.  The indoor hot tub in the main rec centre broke down and was not usable for the three days we were there. But the centre was very nice, and the outside patio was lovely.   We were given a VIP card for discounts at the facilities at Horseshoe Valley resort and around the area and we did use it for dinner at the Crazy Horse restaurant. The waitress was lots of fun and we enjoyed our meals.   This is a nice central location. We used this time to explore the area near Midland to find information for our Ancestry.ca family tree. It was a simple drive to get there and we had fun poking around the various graveyards.",4,positive
230178857,barrie/ca/154980/626450/230178857.html,Carriage Ridge Resort,"We drove up from Syracuse on Sunday night arriving early Monday morning, the jacuzzi Was smooth, we were greeted warmly. We were on our honeymoon, and the room was nice, beds were extremely comfy, and the jacuzzi was so needed after a long 5 hour drive. We did bring food but everything else was there. It was nice to get a call every morning about weather to all activities in the area. The drive to the local shopping area was about 5 miles or more, but the area is so beautiful it's like taking a summer drive. I recommend you take Canadian money, the only bank we could use was Scotia(an affiliate of BOA) but you can only use your ATM card . We had lots of gift cards from our wedding that won't work in Canada. We did some hiking near the resort( a great workout)and drove to a casino (about 20 min) and drove to the riverfront. We will definitely go back again. I loved the resort, we don't ski. But I'm sure the place will be sold out for winters because the area had lots of winter sports areas. We stayed for 5. Days and it's worth the drive.

Back gallery was peeling paint and black stuff. I was there for a week and saw no Reno workers. Pool and rec area was great. Parking good. 30 minute drive to anything but some very interesting things in the 45minute range. Rama casino is worth a visit and has top level entertainment.,4,positive
231099910,barrie/ca/154980/626450/231099910.html,Carriage Ridge Resort,"First thing we looked at through Interval International was the address... Shanty Bay, Ontario. It wasn't anywhere near Shanty Bay, which was southwest and then east of Barrie. Lovely drive on the lake, but Carriage Ridge was not in Shanty Bay. It was 20+ miles from Barrie and 16 miles from Orillia.  The resort is located in the middle of Barrie and Orillia. We are not the normal sightseers. We look for the action of big city living, museums, professional ballgames, etc. But we had hikes and day trips to surrounding areas, lunch in neighboring towns.  As other reviewers testified, the outside of the resort is in bad need of renovation. No workers were seen other than replacing refrigerators in some of the units in Carriage Hill. So we closed our eyes as we climbed the stairs to the 3rd floor unit, our choice.  No complaints about the resort. The staff was friendly and helpful. The community center charged $5 to rent a DVD, $5 for 30 minutes on their computer, coins for the pool table and arcade. WIFI was hit and miss in our rooms. Community hot tub is closed all day Tuesday for cleaning; and then, takes 2 days to warm up to enjoyable therapy.  We were astounded by the prices for groceries and alcohol. Shopped in Barrie before we arrived at the resort. Box of wine is $45 at LCBO! Think prices are linked to the socialist health care system, discouraging any unhealthy behavior. Didn't stop us though.  We had a nice time sitting on the balcony and enjoying the cool weather.

There is a ski hill 100 feet from our back deck and we overlook Horseshoe Valley. There are plenty of golf courses and a lot of other attractions nearby. The exterior of the buildings are a little tired but the rooms are great. We had a 1 bedroom condo with a full kitchen which was very spacious. I am planning to return next fall

The resort is in a secluded area and provides for a quiet and relaxing retreat. Our one bedroom condo was clean and well furnished. Although I must say the couch was definitely in need of being replaced. The kitchen was well supplied and there where BBQ grills outside in the area of each condo. Since my wife and I tend to place a lot of emphasis on the little things, it never ceases to amaze us when it comes to the things places are doing to save money. Upon arrival the check-in staff was less than informative about the activities that were taking place at the resort. Also an activities sheet was not included in the check-in packet. We discovered you had to pick them up at the activities center. It would have been nice if we would have been informed of that when we checked in. As a result we missed out on the arrival BBQ and the Meet and Greet session on Monday morning. What is so hard to understand that the little things are important.

The rooms are very spacious, clean and comfortable.  The kids (7 and 10 years old) love staying at Carriage Ridge, and we usually take advantage of the swimming pool after a day of skiing. We often use the kitchenette to prepare a simple family meal, and wind down with a movie on the DVD player at the end of the day.  My one complaint would be the quality of the bedding supplied for the pull-out sofa. A thin blanket and sheet simply don't do the job in wintertime, especially when a thick duvet is used on the King-size bed in the same room.  Otherwise, we find the resort to offer good value, and the staff is always very friendly and helpful.",4,positive

23804930,barrie/ca/154980/626450/23804930.html,Carriage Ridge Resort,"We booked a single unit along with the lock off unit. We are a family of 7 and had plenty of room for all without bumping into each other. The units were clean and comfortable, even the sofa beds were more comfortable than at most hotels. The kitchen was great and well stocked but I would reccommend that a cookie sheet be added as a part of the supplies. An email to the resort prior to arriving for a list of utensils etc provided in the kitchen would allow better food planning if you are bringing your own. We enjoyed the tubing as a whole family - the kids range in age from 9-20 - and we all thoroughly enjoyed it. The older kids also enjoyed their first boarding experience and found the hills to be just the right size for beginners. Perhaps a shuttle service or the ability to purchase lift tickets at the resort itself would be a neat addition as one of the lifts was only a short distance from our unit and would save having to drive down into the valley. The pool facilities were also enjoyed. This was not my first visit to Carriage Ridge and will definitely not be my last!!!!",5,positive

Resort was easy to find, although the checkin facility was a bit difficult to locate in the dark. I wish I had known that the 2 bedroom suites were laid out by joining the studio and 1 bedroom units. With the bedrooms so far apart, it made it hard to put our young children in one room and the parents in the other. We were very happy with the amenities in the units, which were clean and had lots of towels available. The pool area was a hit with the kids. Wifi was terrible, even when using one of the resort's boosters.

Our one bedroom suite was perfect for everyone to relax in and enjoy dinner after a long day on the hills. Our youngest decided to have a sleep over and had lots of room on the pull out couch in front of the fireplace. Grandpa and Grandma opted for the luxury of the king size bed in the adjoining room.  We found the accommodations very comfortable and quiet any of the staff we encountered were friendly and outgoing. The pool and hot tub configuratioin at Carriage Hills was an added bonous we had never swam outside in the winter before. It was very refreshing and one more adventure to check off our bucket list.

When one lady (the nice one) is unavoidably busy on the phone, while the other two employees are glued to computer consoles with their heads down for 10 minutes ignoring a client in need of assistance, that is inexcusable. Whether it's poor training, or some employees' sense of entitlement to not give a rat's behind about customer service, we won't be returning.

The description says there are 2 pull out couches, they are the worst pull out mattresses EVER!!! Basically just springs covered in fabric so putting the mattress on the floor wouldn't have helped. We called the front desk and they said they have mattress pads because this is a common complaint. Then they said they couldn't access the storage cupboard at this hour, it was 9pm! So my two teenagers who are step brothers had to share a bed which made me really angry, there was no need for that when I paid for a unit that sleeps 8! This resort also claims to have Wi-Fi but when you arrive they say ""Well we have wi-fi it's just basic service so it doesn't work very well"". So they have wi-fi that is not usuable, so they DO NOT have wi-fi bu they claim they do! Then after complaining 3 times I finally talk to the manager who is like ""sorry, there's nothing I can do about that... sorry I can't compensate you even though we didn't deliver on things we claim to have here at the resort..."" totally useless and ignorant! Then the manager says I can call the internet service provider to arrange a service call, I said she she do that for me and said no, she wouldn't! I was so angry I hung up. Then she calls back and says she's sending over the maintenance guy to try something. The maintenance guy comes, unscrews a box behind the side table and hits the re-set button on the router. 15 minutes later TA-DA we have wi-fi, ON DAY 5 after 4 complaints!!! Are you kidding me??? They give you a towel card for a pool towel which they expect you to use for the entire week, the change room floor is covered in sand from the roads so after you dry your filthy feet and ask to exchange for a clean towel they tell you ""sorry there are laundry facilities in your unit and you are expected to take care of that yourself"". I used the 2 packets of dishwasher powder and wanted another pack and they told me I have to buy it. WHAT?! When we arrived there was grease splatter all over the cabinets.

The setup was great in that the Jacuzzi tub was adjacent to a huge vanity area, which was separated from yet another bathroom with toilet and huge walk in shower, so each person could have the privacy if needed. Everything was spotlessly clean, and it was a bonus to have access to a FREE washer/dryer shared with the adjoining suite.

I was very impressed by the Jacuzzi tub and practically spent as much time in it as I could.   The staff on check in were very helpful, and the couple of calls to ensure that my stay was going well were very appreciated.   Prior to my actual trip, I was assisted by one of the managers with setting up some activities, as I was travelling solo, and needed some ideas on how to maximize and get the best out of my trip.  Overall, I had an extremely pleasant stay, and will be booking my next stay with this resort in the near future.

278621465,barrie/ca/154980/626450/278621465.html,Carriage Ridge Resort,"We heard about this place through friends going before. Their impression wasn't great, but we decided to give it a try after further review.A little confusing at first between Carriage Ridge and Carriage Hills and required for us to call to see what the suble differences were. We were glad we ended up with Carriage Ridge. It appears the resort is owned by Wyndham and when there are booking inquiries/questions/concerns, then you are connected through them, rather than resort. There was a bit of a delay when changing my reservation, but it all worked out.  We were initially set to go over Victoria Day long weekend. We were able to go prior due to last minute change in schedule, which made a difference in the price. Because check-in is not until 4 pm, you may be going during rush hour during the week.   We arrived just around 5 pm on a Wednesday. Check in was fairly good and was not busy, assuming due to time of day. We requested a high chair and crib during booking and again asked the front desk during check in. I assumed they were distracted by our baby and may have forgotten the request. However, they were accommodating in getting us a suite without anybody above to keep noise to a minimum and ended up with the 2nd floor out of 3 without anybody above.  We booked a 1 bedroom suite and ended up very close to the recreation centre and main office. We had to follow up for our high chair and crib which came quite quickly after we called. There are certain aspects of the suite that are recently renovated, and certain aspects that have not. Overall impression is not bad at all. We did not realize this is a property that is also a time-share, but did not get pushed into presentation (perhaps as not busy season yet?)  The suite was well equipped and the renovations helped give it a modern feel. The only issues we had was a fireplace with the pilot out (it was colder than we would have liked the first night) and the vent above the toilet was not working (the suite has 2 vents). Also did not understand why the dishwasher soap was not in the suite and had to request, which was free only one time request at rec centre.  The building next to us was being painted. Did not appreciate though how the painters/workers were quite loud and chatty and one painter was inappropriate with his comments about songs/girls. Fortunate that nobody was around and my son not old enough to understand, but still, not appropriate if you're on a job site.   We were up early on day 1 to try aqua fit, but did not realize it was at other resort, so we had to drive there after walking to our rec centre. We arrived late, but instructor and participants were more than welcoming. The pool as on the colder side, but not bad, but a bit cold for our baby. The kiddy pool was definitely way too cold. The whirpool and was not as hot as usual, which worked in our favour as not too hot for baby. We then tried the pool close to us which was again on the colder side. It was a good concept where half the pool was indoor and the other half was outdoor. Unfortunately, there was work being done on the interlocking on the outdoor portion, which kept is off limits.   We took a walk around the ground and part of the trails before realizing the one we took was around the compound, rather than towards dirt bike and street to other resort. Otherwise, we felt the ground were maintained nicely. It is about a 5 minute drive to a gas station, grocery store and LCBO from the site. So, if you forget something, it's not that bad.   We were fairly satisfied with our suite otherwise. It is far enough from the hustle and bustle of the city, without it being too far, especially during peak ""exodus"" seasons in the summer and winter. Our package included free passes to the Wye Marsh, which was further north than I assumed, but worth the visit. We are definitely open to coming back for another short stay, perhaps during a different season to see the difference. Not sure about owning a time-share or a longer stay overall, or during peak weekends, etc.",4,positive

The reception at the Front Office was good and worthy of praise. They were detailed and explained about the facility with patience. The entire holiday went well, with only one drawback - the wifi at the resort wasn't good. Well we were cautioned on checking in that the wifi would be slow but it was unfortunate that it didn't work for 2 full days and that was a challenge to stay incommunicado.  Overall, the resort was clean, quiet and worthwhile, despite being far away from the city.",4,positive

This time we just rented a one bedroom for the weekend (2 nights) to attend the mountain bike race at hardwood hills - which is very close - 5 minutes. The appt had everything we needed and was spacious and comfortable. We asked for a quiet room on the top floor and this is what we got!  Check in and check out was painless - very fast and efficient. The free wifi wasn't working in the room - so we went to the recreation centre to use wifi - not far. We didn't use the facilities of the resort - so cannot comment on the pool etc. As mentioned by other reviewers the outside of the buildings need some maintenance (paint etc) - but the inside is clean and comfortable. We will return for the Pan Am weekend.

We both booked our own condo's, and asked if they could be near each other. We were booked right next door. We booked on-line and each received a compllimentary adult tow ticket, this was amazing.  Our condo was immaculate complete with your own laundry soap in case you wanted to wash snow suits or even bathingsuits. The kids could come and go as they pleased as everyone had a room key and the chair lift was right there.... The bathroom was huge, and there towels galore...there was even a safe in the room. I had read the previous reviews and they mentioned to bring extra blankets as the room may be cold. So we did but there were extra blankets in the closet and you could control your own temperature in the condo.

We were booked for a week through a timeshare exchange but left after 3 days. We asked for a third floor unit so as not to hear feet above us and were rewarded with a view straight into the dumpster from our little balcony. The units were getting a new roof and the workers did not clean up well, leaving lots of debris on the steps and sidewalk. Our neighbors came as a group and partied in the parking lot til 12 on Friday night and until 2 am Saturday night. Security was not evident although there is an 11pm noise curfew as a courtesy to your neighbors. They left lots of cigarette butts behind and one from the group stayed longer. We only know that because we could hear the thumpa, thumpa of his music until 2am Sunday. We left Monday exhausted feeling a stay cation would be more relaxing. As I said, the place is getting a facelift which I hope includes re painting. Our unit was OK with a decent bed but the refrigerator had a non-working freezer (our ice cream was softer than soft serve). Our other reason to leave early was that there was little to do at the resort. I don't want to swim in an indoor pool in July. We had to drive too far to find activities such as hiking or anything that did not have an admission fee. This was not a good fit for us.",3,negative

This visit we were quite disappointed, rooms are getting a bit dated, the couches are pullouts but nobody was able to sleep on them due to the extremely poor mattresses, you can feel all the springs right through even the smaller kid was unable to sleep on it, we have had the same issue in the past but they seem to have gotten even worse. The couches for sitting even are quite uncomfortable with the cushions being flatter and more worn, they really need replacing. The main complaint is that our Wi-Fi would not work at all in the room but was fine at the pool area or outside around the resort. We also prefer the pool and facilities at Carriage Hills and usually stay there instead of Ridge but this time they were full.

No one was willing to help us, even the manager standing right next to her employee, that wouldn't even come talk to us.  The room smelt like old gym socks, like it hadn't been cleaned in ages. They were deceiving about having a shuttle to the boots and hearts festival, when we asked about it they had no idea what we were talking about even after showing them the advertisement online. Told us we'd have to take a 100$ can ride each way (2 ways / 3 days!)

This makes it easy to access the downhill ski section of Horseshoe Valley. It is the section that is also open for night skiing. When we were skiing it looked as if there was no longer access to downhill skiing from the Hills resort (although I may be wrong about this). You definitely cannot easily access downhill night skiing from the Hills resort. We like to book the one bedroom suites that have a living room, dining area, full kitchen, fireplace, Jacuzzi and private balcony. On this trip we had room 3426 which is very close to an access point for downhill skiing. The only problems with this room was that it was on the third floor and the wifi was slow. We had many fun hours down hill and cross-country skiing this trip. We are coming back for more next weekend.

We went on March Break so it was packed. Check in wasn't until 4pm, but I'd recommend being there at 3 pm because check in took over half an hour! They forced each check in to talk to a clerk specifically trying to sell you a time share which I thought was a bit unnecessary and kept stressing the resort was under new management. Our room was on the third level so lots of wooden stairs to navigate in the rain. And added bonus was that our room door was wide open when we got to it. We discovered it wouldn't latch or lock properly. A quick call to the desk and it was fixed by a friendly maintenance staff in 20 min. Other than that hiccup, the room was tidy and clean with a nice kitchenette fully stocked with plates, cups and cutlery. We didn't use many of the resort amenities because we spent the days hiking, but used the pool every day. It was a fair sized pool and two hot tubs. It was very crowded because of the week we chose however in reasonable condition considering the crowd. Every day we received a voicemail encouraging us to attend a seminar for time share purchase - something that annoyed. We were told also that they did not have fast internet speed so we didn't try to use it.  Given the pros and cons, we can only rate this vacation as mediocre",3,negative

I chose Carraige Hills Resort which is a part of the Carraige Ridge Resort (newer section I think). What a great choice it was! After being a little apprehensive about the choice at first, it was quickly dismissed upon arriving at the resort. The welcoming staff were absolutely fantastic and actually took time to call around some of the Golf courses for us to book in some games for the weekend. We got a VIP card that got us some great discounts at the better courses. 3 great courses within 5 minutes drive (1 actually across the street!). The accomodations couldn't be any better! We had booked a two bedroom, which actually was a one bedroom and a Studio with a common entrance door. This gave my partner a suite for himself complete with bathroom and kitchenette, King size bed and balcony. if you leave the suite doors open to the entranceway you have full access to both suites. The one bedroom part was gorgeous. Large master bedroom with king size bed ensite bathroom with Jaccuzzi tup and double sinks which also led into the smaller bathroom with glass door shower and another sink and toilet. This gave each of us our own private bathroom. This smaller bathroom also had access from the living room. The full kitchen with an Island counter, built in oven and counter top range was fully stocked with everything you need. All the dishes,cutlery pots and pans. Dishwasing soap for built-in dishwasher laundry soap for the washer and dryer. plus a few other great stuff. The living room was well appointed with a full pull out couch which pulls out to a queen size bed. All the beds were absolutely confortable, the best I have ever had in a hotel or resort.

I booked this 4 months in advance to secure the unit I wanted. Forward to July 28, 2016 (only TWO days before our arrival), I received a phone all from someone named Jacob stating that the resort had to change my booking to a studio!!! A studio DOES NOT contain a fully equipped kitchen to cook, a jacuzzi, or fireplace. As you can imagine, I was pissed!   He stated that the reason was due to renovations that have not been completed. I asked Jacob why they would call me TWO days prior (1 hour prior before the non-refundable cancellation deadline might I add) to our arrival to tell me this when I'm SURE the resort knew well in advance that renovations were taking place and wouldn't be finished. Jacob said that they hoped that the renovations would've been completed but it wasn't. He said they would give me a $50 credit per night (I booked two nights) as a way to say sorry. I told Jacob that if I wanted a cheaper unit, then I would be booked cheaper unit. I expressed my disgust about their poor bad business of calling me so late leaving me with zero alternative to book elsewhere (it's a long weekend. Everywhere has been booked for months). I was basically left with a ruined long weekend of going no where or having to suck it up and take the small unit. I feel so badly for families with small children who were in my position and relying on a kitchen to cook.   Because of this change, I had to ruin the surprise and tell my fiancé of what happened. He said to just make the best of it and go since everywhere else was booked (I checked). Since cooking wasn't an option, we had to eat out for breakfast (twice) and dinner (twice). We had to drive to Barrie (20mim away) to eat (since spending large amounts on money for fine dining in the area wasn't an option). The only highlight was the time spent with my fiancé.   My recommendation: don't risk booking here. Book at Horseshoe Resort which is a two minute drive away from Carriage. There are more outdoor activities to do their (that's the resort Carriage send their customers to ski). We take our advice and booked there for our winter getaway for New Years Eve.   This review would've been so different if management personally called me instead of young Jacob who is probably a summer student to take the heat and offered to comp my stay or give me a credit towards another vacation. Instead, after I made Jacob tell his manager how upset I was and see if they can find me another similar unit that I booked close by at another resort, I got a, ""sorry. My manager said there is nothing else."" Bad business. Won't stay here again.   As for the studio unit itself, it's a typical hotel room but with a sink, coffee maker, and microwave.

41377330,barrie/ca/154980/626450/41377330.html,Carriage Ridge Resort,"This is a great resort. We exchanged our Gold Crown through RCI for Carriage Hills Resort, and were switched to Carriage Ridge at check in. (Both are RCI Gold Crown resorts.). Approximately two hours north of Toronto on the 401/400. Signage to the resort was somewhat limited, but the resorts are actually very near the 217? exit off the 400. Arrived to a nice welcome and the news that we were switched to from Carriage Hills. We were concerned that the one-bedroom apartment into which we had exchanged (from the 2 bed we own in Madeira) would be small. We had absolutely no reason to fear. Our second floor one bed at this resort was spacious (except for the closets) and very well appointed, even down to a laundry, shared only with the adjacent studio unit. There is also a small deck. The units share a regularly cleaned and maintained BBQ area and there is a relatively small indoor swimming pool. This resort, like Carriage Hills and Horseshoe are primarily for golfers (which we are not) and for skiers. So, as other reviewers, have indicated, there is not much in the immediate area - but if you look, there is actually quite a lot to see if you are interested in historical sites. Second day, we tried to get to Tobermory on the Georgian Bay, which is apparently a very nice town to see, and there are other nice places on the way. However, it is really too far for a day trip from this resort, especially when it is pouring down with rain; we gave up after passing through Owen Sound and Collingwood on Georgian Bay. Avoid the latter at more or less all costs: Collingwood is a town of condos and largely because of this it is unattractive. Be sure to visit the Tom Thomson Art Gallery in Owen Sound, which houses an excellent permanent exhibition of memorabilia and artwork by the celebrated Canadian painter. The Black History Museum is worth seeing, largely because it is located in the beautiful Harrison Park, but don't expect to see anything indoors. Great for a picnic though. The museum is a poignant reminder that slaves from below the border were able to escape to Canada. Other places to visit include the moderately interesting town of Orillia, which also has a nice park and a splendid statue of Champagne in the park near the marina on Lake Simcoe. But, we found by far the most interesting places to visit were around Midland (on Georgian Bay). Be sure to visit Discovery Harbour, where you will see an old British fort from the 1812 War, as well as two reproduction ships; Sainte-Marie Among the Hurons, which was the 17th century HQ for the French Jesuit mission to the Hurons and Huron Village, with guides in historic clothing; and the less impressive Huron Ouendat Village. And if it's a nice day, do go on the 3-hour Miss Midland boat cruise (with excellent commentary) to the 30,000 islands around Beausoleil Island. Check out the Resort Activities brochure you get at checkin.  Amenities. There is a really excellent Foodlands supermarket in nearby Craighurst, as well as a gas station. There are several restaurants in the immediate area, but none of them are good enough to write home about. We tried Settler's Ghost and the apparently ""elegant"" Silks Fine Dining restaurant at the Horseshoe resort. Both were disappointing, the latter because it was extremely expensive for the quality of food and service and the supposedly wonderful view over Horseshoe Valley was blocked by a tent. Our recommendation would be to stick with the BBQ, or eat in. You can also hire bicycles on site, and there are some nice walks around the resort. Also the resort provides complimentary wifi.  One thing to watch: we asked for a quiet room, and were located at the end of a block on the second floor. Unfortunately, a rowdy drinking group arrived and disturbed our sleep at about 2.30 am. We complained the next morning; apparently, we should have called security when we were disturbed. Anyway, whatever happened, they were gone the following morning by 10 am checkout.  We would certainly return. This is an excellent resort, albeit somewhat isolated.",4,positive

The room was quiet and offered us a great sleep , after spending all day at the flea Market we wre very tired and looking forwrd to a good nights rest. The only suggestion I have, it would be nice to have a restaurant on the premises. After arriving at night tired you do not always fell like having to get in your car and drive elsewhere , or be able to have a nice breakfast before leaving in the morning.",5,positive

The property is gorgeous, well looked after, and quiet. Just less than 20 minutes outside of Barrie. We booked the rate where you do not have your linens or towels changed each day, just the garbage changed...not a problem because the units have shared laundry rooms so you can toss your towels in the dryer if they are still damp. Upon discovering the mini-fridge and kitchenette, we headed to a nearby grocery store and picked up some things for breakfast and dinner - there are also bbq pavilions with picnic tables and utencils in the suite to use! We saved nearly $100 by not having to buy breakfast each day and dinner that evening. The kitchen is fully stocked with dinnerware, wine glasses, a kettle, toaster, casserole…. I would recommend packing a cooler and bringing a few things from home – bbq sauce, milk whatever you like!  Our third night we had a stay and play package...not all hotels will allow you to do this, book 2 rates during the same 'stay'. We requested to not have to switch rooms and that was noted and was not a problem. Our room was made up however - we were not expecting this. We golfed at Settler's Ghost, a beautiful course, and not terribly difficult for new golfers - I am a new golfer this year and played the full round with the same ball. Oh we were also greeted with a surprise gift when we arrived - part of the stay and play package. Overall we had an unbelievable holiday, we will return again and again!",5,positive

The positive is that there are a lot of activities very close by (i.e. restaurants at Horseshoe, ziplining, golf etc all within a very short drive.

The laundry machines are just outside the door too. There are walking paths all around and plenty of do in the activities centre. There are pools, sunning areas, games and DVDs to rent.   The village of Craighurst nearby offers a couple restaurants for anytime of day and a good supermarket with a liquor store for all your grocery needs.   September seemed to be a relatively quiet month at Carriage Ridge and we were thankful for that as well. Our baby didn't disturb others and we weren't disturbed.  The surroundings are gorgeous in September with the leaves starting to turn colours, the days still hot enough for swimming and the air clean and crisp.

You can do downhill or tubing as well. Our 1-bedroom was absolutely fabulous: relatively new, spacious, with Jacuzzi, fireplace, two TV sets and full kitchen. They put all small but necessary things in kitchen cabinets including flashlight. The staff is very friendly. They checked us in well in advance of normal time. Our friends enjoyed a swimming pull (partially outdoor) and sauna as well. They have wireless internet, but sometimes it’s getting slow. I recommend the resort for everybody who wants to have a good outdoor, with skiing in winter time and cycling/golfing in summer. But if you are looking for fancy restaurants, find another place to stay.  Because of close proximity to Toronto, reasonable price and excellent accommodation, we already stayed there three times and want to visit again.",5,positive

We had a child who became ill and housekeeping was prompt and friendly helped us out with everything! I didn't get to the pool but I know several others had lots of fun there!  My 1 bedroom suite was beautiful and I loved the jaccuzi tub and relaxing in front of the fire place! The kitchen was well equipped and had everything we needed.

We facilitated the Hot tub/Pool... as well as enjoyed the jacuzzi, right in the room!  We came up for our 2nd time last weekend, spent one night together then invited another couple up to come out Snowboarding/Skiing with us. It was a great time, minus a minor wipeout ;).   *The only problems I had with the resort was 1 of the daytime staff wasn't very pleasant upon noticing I was young and belonged to Shell Vacations!? Oh well.   *I also had 1 problem at Horseshoe - I was supposed to get a 20% discount on my lift tickets and rentals (I had purchased for 4 people). Upon presenting my Shell card, I was denied a discount due to uninformed employees/supervisors. Since I had never previously used this card for discounts myself, I just let it go, when I should've fought it and asked to speak with a manager!?   All in All: The 4 of us had an amazing time!

54584810,barrie/ca/154980/626450/54584810.html,Carriage Ridge Resort,"Being disappointed with the reviews for the actual Horseshoe ski resort properties I looked around and found Carriage Ridge Resort and liked the fact that they were advertising ski in/ski out access. After reading the multitude of stellar reviews for both Carriage Ridge and Carriage Hills Resorts (and with the price being WAY lower than staying at Horseshoe), we decided to book a snowboard weekend at Carriage Ridge. We couldn't have been happier! The ski in/ski out access was excellent, and because it was hard for me to find information on exactly where the hotel was situated I'll let eveyrone know here. Carriage Ridge basically sits right above the left side of the ski hill, the exact run you end up on is called Donkey Serenade and it is a GREEN run so pretty much any level of skier/snowboarder can get down. From our window facing the slopeside, we were able to see the top of the C5 Highrider triple chairlift at Horseshoe. Tip: get your discounted lift tickets from the front desk and you can basically just ski right on the hill and not even worry about going to the chalet to get your ticket! What a convenience it was on a busy Saturday morning! Just make sure you're back at the lift by about 8:55 PM or you could be in danger of missing the last lift up and have to walk the hill, it wouldn't be fun!  As for the property itself, it was fantastic. We took advantage of the pool (open till 10, 9 for kids), hot tub, bbqs and shared laundry (only shared with next door neighbor). They have a nice lounge with pool table and fireplace as well as a fitness room in the same building. In the room, the fireplace was nice, the room had a games table and a big dinner table. The kitchen was well stocked and had utensils for everything, blender, dishwasher, you name it! There was a place just inside the door to put your ski/snowboard equipment as well. When we arrived, the front desk gave us a little cooler for free with about a dozen hand/foot warmers along with the lift tickets. Is this place for real? Am I dreaming?  If I had to pick between staying at Carriage Hills or Carriage Ridge and if I was planning on skiing/snowboarding, I would choose Ridge. Carriage Hills looked like they had ski in/ski out access to the last run on the left at Horseshoe (the run is a green run called Canter), which was great, except for one thing: there is no night skiing on those leftmost runs and you wouldn't be able to get home past 4 PM! Go Carriage Ridge for sure if you're planning to night ski.  I can only think of three little things I would say that could improve this place: 1) a front desk check-in at Carriage Ridge (you need to drive down to check-in at Carriage Hills 2) a restaurant on site. We were very hungry after Friday night skiing and had to go into Barrie to grab something 3) sofa bed was not the best for comfort (but king sized in bedroom was amazing).  If you're thinking of staying anywhere NEAR this place you have to do yourself a favor and book something now. We are actually going to be making this a yearly trip because we liked it so much.   Oh, and we didn't get any weird calls or solicitations for any timeshares like the one reviewer below experienced, shrug.",5,positive

Not small enough to walk from area to area comfortably, so you’ll have to drive and park (for free) a bit.  Food – Pretty slim pickings for vegetarians, so we went into Barrie for dinner.  Accomodation – Keep in mind the lack of elevators when planning how much you pack! Great size rooms, with huge bathroom. The kitchenette in the 2 bedroom suite is amazing. They even provide cutlery, small appliances and cooking utensils.  Amenities – The gym is tiny and underdeveloped, although the 2 indoor pools are good sized. Too many wild teenagers jumping and splashing around to enjoy, though, especially for our toddler!

We were all blown away with how nice this resort is, and the excellent location. We had kids from 1-12 with us, who all had a great time. Skiing at Horseshoe is great, affordable (get passes at Costco), and you can't beat the convenience of skiing back to your room for a break and a glass of wine during the day!  Positives: - Easy to get to from Toronto - Ski-in to Horseshoe (easy to ski down to pick up lift tickets first thing in the AM) - Huge rooms, in great condition, and well furnished - Great pools with lots of toys. Good hot tub. Nice changing facilities too. - A price you can't really get at any other ski resort in the province  Negatives: - Parking lot was pretty consistently full, making finding a spot tricky at times - They went crazy on the de-icing salt on the walkways - meaning it was tracked into our unit as well - Check-in at Carriage Hills is a bit of a pain - No restaurant, and local choices are limited for families. But there is a supermarket nearby.  We will be back for sure. Probably once more in the winter, and then in the spring or summer, with bikes and hiking boots instead of skis.",5,positive

Kristina, I think that was her name, at the front desk, was excellent. She did everything she could to make our stay enjoyable and as hassle-free as she could.  We had arrived early - traffic and weather wasn't as bad as predicted, and Kristina facilitated our early check-in, and allowed us to check-out 1 hour later - as the resort wasn't at capacity that day. True this may not seem like a lot, but an extra hour to settle in, and then wake up and pack up at the end of our stay made all the difference and certainly added to the restful experience. Great service!  She explained and directed us to the facilities avaialble at and around the resort, and upon check out when we were looking to go cross-country skiing, highlighted the discounted rates we'd receive at the resort - what more could we ask for?!  The room was one of the best we've stayed in. Jacuzzi tub and shower, King-size and sofa bed, full kitchen, and access to a washer and dryer. A vacation home away from home indeed. Clean, spacious, and comfortable. Everyone slept well, with no complaints.  The location is spectacular, about an hour north of Toronto - great trails, peaceful, lots to do in and around the resort area.

59960890,barrie/ca/154980/626450/59960890.html,Carriage Ridge Resort,"We just stayed at this resort with a hockey team along with many of their parents and siblings. We were in the section farthest away from the resort's main office. This was our second stay at this resort and we were in a suite. Many teams from the town we reside in have been using this resort to stay in year after year. 1st- I have to say that the rooms are absolutely outstanding and of good value. There is a definite WOW factor upon entering the rooms as the decor is modern and of great taste. The suites have a full kitchen including a stove, full fridge, microwave, blender, coffee maker and all the pots pans, utensils, ect. that you might need. The resort has clearly gone far above and beyond in constructing this resort; utilizing luxury materials such as granite for counter tops, placing a fireplace in the living room and a jacuzzi tub in the on suite bath. No complaints regarding any of the accommodations, only rave reviews. BUT without any doubt: the pool caused chemical burns to many of our children (I would estimate 30%) and this has occurred for the past 3 years at least. (to my knowledge) the burns were of varying degrees but ranged from just itchiness to bright red skin head to toe. The children who were burned badly were crying and screaming (no exaggeration) and fevered with shivers as a direct result from the pool. Symptoms were similar to that of a very very bad sunburn and occurred even after the children showered right after their swim. Our son was one of the ones affected severely 2 years ago and we applied zinc cream and administered advil in an effort to not have to make a trip to the ER. It kept us from having to make that trip, our boy however, would only lay in bed and watch TV from 6PM on while his friends, that he would normally be playing with, were out playing and having fun. So we knew he was feeling very unwell. We had heard this same story with similar experiences from other parents that had gone previous years but before it happened to us we brushed it off as an over exaggeration, sensitive skin, ect. It was NOT. Many of the other parents had packed Benadryl on this trip because of past experience. Our party, by the way, included 2 RNs plus 2 other medical professionals. The smell of the chlorine/bromine in the pool room is almost unbearable and there is clearly an issue here that needs to be addressed.  Hugely unfortunate is the resort manager is defensive and refuses to admit that there is a problem . We wrote a letter 2 years ago explaining what had happened and the manager's position then, as it is now, is that the resort abides by ministry guidelines so there is no issue, period. We were told that we are the only ones that have had a problem or who have complained.... and we know for a fact that this is untrue since 4 or 5 children in our group alone had problems and that complaints have been made, not to mention countless others throughout previous years whose parents we have spoken to first hand. We normally never write bad reviews publicly and we prefer to address issues privately between the parties involved. The resort however, had completely ignored our concerns from 2 years ago and is still as unwilling to even consider the fact that there might be a problem here. It is unfortunate because it is such a beautiful place to stay, that customers (as we did) return, but children are getting hurt in the process, and worst of all, once the resort has collected your $, they don't care in the least.  tip: If you do go and allow your child to swim in the pool........layering a thick coating of vaseline before they go into the pool helps protect their skin quite effectively. We've never had to do this at other hotels but our only other option was to not allow our children into the pool but to basically, have them sit poolside and watch all their friends having fun. Not the option we chose.",4,positive

The hotel was very accommodating with this type of group. Providing a hospitality suite was an excellent way to keep the team all together for potlucks and social time. We respected the no noise policy and as most of the kids were tired after a long day this was not a problem The swimming pool was a great distraction for them. The play area and the resort itself I was very impressed with. I was just sorry that there was no snow to be able to use the slopes.

Even if you book via the hotel's website you will get a good rate. BUT... the location is quite a way off the main roads and you will need to drive pretty much every where.  The resort is a time share operation, geared to people who drive to the site and want to just relax. There is no restaurant, room service or bar on site, and you would have to drive to even get to the Horseshoe Valley facilities.  In the couple of years I have been going to the place, I have noticed a deterioration in the fixtures. The sofa in the room from my most recent stay was past the acceptable wear level for a 3 start facility, closer to a 1 star level. The doors in the two unit suite did not close properly without considerable effort. Wireless internet was effectively unusable and there is no wired internet available in the suite. I was trying to get some work done during my stay and had to go into Orillia to get a good connection.  The place is fine, the rooms are clean, the pool facility (across the parking lot in a separate building) is nice. I am sure that most of their clients do not want to get work done so the internet connectivity is not relevant to them, but if you are a business traveler:  1. You are probably at this location by accident  2. You will want to get back on the road ASAP.",3,negative

The room was more than comfortable for two people and the sofa is a queen pullout if needed. I will give information I wish I had known prior.  If arriving on Sunday by car (via airport) stop by Barrie and get some food and beverage for the night. The (nearby) Craighurst Foodland closes early.  When checking in read the signs that say take a left on Highland Drive for checkin. It is a bit past the Carriage Ridge area. Carriage Ridge and Carriage Hills are the same checkin.  If your cash card (ATM) is a Visa debit card: None of the onsite ATM machines will work. There are only two banks in Ontario that have Visa on their network. CIBC and RBC (Royal Bank of Canada). There are plenty of locations in Orlillia and Barrie. This will save you a day of searching.  Compared to the US of A the food and beverage is somewhat expensive.  You can only buy beer or wine at a LCBO location. There is one co-located in Craighurst Foodland. If you like Bud Select (low carb) then try the Molson 67. I still can't believe it has only 2 carbs and 67 calories. If they sold it here it would be my beer of choice.  We visited Midland and took the Georgian Bay cruise. It was very nice. We ate at the restaurant on the wharf. The steak sandwich was great and they do have really good fries. We went on our own but they have a tour at the resort. While in the area we visited Discover Harbour. If you plan to visit both Discovery Harbour and St Marie Among the Hurons go to Discovery Harbour first. Both attractions are run by the same company. You get a 50 percent off ticket coupon for the either. St Marie Among the Huron is more expensive so you can save a little money.  We did the Toronto Tour on Wednesday and the Niagara Falls tour on Thursday. I recommend both, but it aint cheap. Both leave from the Carriage Hills clubhouse (where you checkin). We enjoyed them both. Niagara Falls is not to be missed and you can't beat the view from CN Tower.  If you drive into Barrie, leaving from the resort, take a left at the stop light (Craighurst Foodland/Esso) (Pentenguishine Road) it takes you right into the Lake Simcoe. At the same intersection take a right.  I did not bring clubs but there are very beautiful golf courses everywhere.  I had burgers at both the Last Yard and Crazy Horse. They were both great.  If you go, enjoy your stay...we did. I have a youtube video of about 500 pics of our visit. It lasts about 4 minutes but you get the ""picture"" of the area.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_XH-PqGZQk",5,positive
70172752,barrie/ca/154980/626450/70172752.html,Carriage Ridge Resort,"Our family owns a timeshare with Carriage Ridge, so everytime my boyfriend and I feel the need for a weekend getaway, we head up.   Suites - The rooms are very large and beautifully decorated. The main room has an open floor plan. The kitchen is fully stocked (utensils and dishes) and has updated appliances, a large granite countertop, and a deep sink. The living room has a fireplace, television, stereo system (with iPod hookup), DVD player, pullout couch, coffee table, and a dining/games area. There is also a balcony for each suite. The bedroom has another TV and radio with iPod hookup and a king sized bed. The washroom is very large, has a jacuzzi tub and a separate shower. The only problem I have had with the room is that the pullout couch is not terribly comfortable. It's standard fare though: I'm not sure a comfy pullout exists!  - We have never personally had a problem with the Internet during any of our stays, but I have heard some other people we know mention that their internet was inconsistent. I suppose it is just the luck of the room location.   Amenities: - We have stayed in both Carriage Ridge and Carriage Hills. We found that Carriage Hills had a slightly better pool area, just because the pool is indoor/outdoor and there is an outdoor hot tub. However, both of the pools are clean and we have never had a problem with too much chlorine that I saw another reviewer mention. We really enjoy swimming from 9-10 pm when it is adult swim only - yet would love it if they stayed open until at least 11 because we are night owls.  - You can rent board games from the Carriage House (where the pool is) and there is also horseshoes and shuffleboard. Finally, Carriage Ridge also has a game area where you can play pool or video games (these cost extra).  - We have never attended any, but the resort offers activities (mostly family oriented) throughout the day. I believe there is a schedule on their website.   Food: - As stated in other reviews, there is no restaurant or bar on site.  - We are aware of the isolated location when we go up, so we bring our own food and cook all of our meals in the room. However, it is nice that there are restaurants nearby (not walking distance) if we want a night off, and a grocery store nearby (again, not walking distance) if we forgot anything -- this time it was maple syrup.  - On our way out, we usually eat at Loobies (Horseshoe Valley Road and Penatanguishine). They have deceptively AMAZING food - especially the lasagna. Very family friendly and affordable as well.   Staff:  - All the staff that we have encountered are very friendly and help to suggest activities when asked.  - We received a VIP card when checking in, which gave us great discounts for lots of activities in the surrounding area. However, I am not sure if this is offered to all guests or only people who have a timeshare.   Location: - For out of towners, I wouldn't really suggest staying here if you plan to spend the majority of your time in Toronto and/or Niagara Falls. Although they do have day trips to each of those locations, the resort is much much further North. It is more suited for people visiting Wasaga Beach in the summer, skiing at Horseshoe Valley in the winter, or people who want to be away from city life. - There are a lot of outdoor activities to keep you busy. A few places nearby that we have enjoyed:  - Wye Marsh (20 minutes away): Great wetlands area with birds, turtles, and other small animals. There are small walkways to explore and we also booked a guided kayak trip here, which was very peaceful and informative. The only issue we had with Wye Marsh was the directions. If you google map the location, it leads you to a back entrance that is not accessible (the front desk at Carriage Hills provided us with a printout of Google maps directions). Luckily there were some friendly locals who noticed us standing confused on the side of the road and they directed us to the front entrance. It is right next to Ste-Marie Among the Hurons. To be safe, if you ask for the front desk to get you directions, just ask for them to Ste-Marie on the Huron. The entrances are linked: you turn left for Wye Marsh and right for Ste-Marie.   - Springwater (25 minutes away): An official Ontario Park which is also a refuge for Canadian wildlife - including bears, wolves, owls, swans, etc.  - Discovery Harbour (20 minutes away): A historic site with displays about Canadian history (cooler than it sounds).  - Ste-Marie Among the Hurons (20 minutes away): A discovery centre showing the history and lifestyle of natives and original settlers in Canada.   - Horseshoe Valley Adventure Park (5 minutes away): Newly opened park located at the Horseshoe Valley Resort. It has a rock climbing wall, ZORBING!!! (awesome), mini-putt, a BMX/skate park, tubing down the ski slopes (in summer as well), and a massive zipline. So much fun - you can definitely spend an entire day here.   - Treetop Trekking (5 minutes away): Located at the Horseshoe Valley Resort, this was one of the most exciting things I have ever done. We actually did this last fall when we stayed at the resort -- and we booked our time for first thing in the morning, which proved to be an important part of why our experience was so great. Tree-Top Treking (TTT) is a series of obstacle courses that are way up in the air, attached to trees. Bridges, rope walls, steps, rings, and many other unique features. You are harnassed in and have to maneouvre through the obstacles and across zip lines to reach the end of the course. It was very difficult, but very rewarding. I have a fear of heights, but was able to overcome it with the help of my boyfriend and our kind (and patient!) guide. You book for a certain time frame and you get to do as many courses as you can in the allotted time. Apparently if you do TTT in the afternoon, there can be a backlog of people, which means you will move slower through the courses and will not get to experience all of the different routes. Since we went first thing in the morning, we got through every single course and got to do the large zip line at the end. Overall it was just an amazing experience. We were sore the next few days though - especially in the arms and upper body.   - Segway Tours: Located at the Horseshoe Valley Resort - we have never done them, but think we will on our next trip up!   The Little Things: - If there are any utensils that are not included in the stocked kitchen, you can rent them free of charge from the Carriage House (where the pool is). For example, larger pots, potato masher, casserole dishes, etc.   ** Will add photos when I get home **",5,positive

If you want a variety of foods you will need to drive to Orillia or rent a regular suite with a full kitchen to prepare your own.

The stay itself was ok, however 2 days after we left we recieved an email informing us of $130 in extra charges, a messy room and a damp mattress. With this they included 15 or so pic's of our room that showed some wrappers on the floor and a closeup of a tim hortons cup sitting on the bathroom counter. It would have taken less time to clean the room than it did to take the pictures. When we tried to contact Carriage Ridge about this to explain that our son with special needs had spilled his drink on the bed and that we had no housekeeping for the entire stay but had changed out the sheets ourselves we recieved absolutely no response from management. Very disappointing and frustrating. Its sad to see that Carriage Ridge has no compassion for those with special needs. Won't be returning there.",1,negative

I made several changes to the package as time went on and they were more than accommodating.  Once we finally arrived, the front desk staff were courteous and efficient. The rooms are amazing; large, big fluffy beds, full kitchenette, nice TV and a patio. All for under $100! In my opinion, absolutely blows a regular hotel room right out of the water!!

In addition, the resort also has a bbq area which you can use. The resort has a small indoor pool & a hot tub. But the pool water was kinda cold. They provide noodles & other floating device which makes it more fun for the kids. You have to register @ the Ridge Club to use the pool. Entrance to the pool is through the washroom. There's no sign how to get to the pool area.  Kid's playground is next to the Ridge club. You must bring your own food supplies esp. if you're staying for few nights. Nothing is around this area. To check-in you must go to Carriage Hills Resort which is about 3-5 mins drive from the Ridge. For check-out, you can just call the reception. Overall, this resort is like home away from home.

I was so surprised to see how many food options/choices there were. I really enjoyed the do it yourself waffle station and fresh fruit too. I am a female and almost 7 months pregnant, I was alone and felt completely safe. The front desk staff Luke even placed a courtesy call to see how my room was.

You get great value for your money with nice comfortable clean rooms and always a swimming pool which our kids enjoy after being stuck in a car for hours.  We spent 2 nights at this hotel during Family day weekend. The hotel was very nice- and even better then we expected. They had a family suite (bank beds for the kids and an x-box that they liked) which we never had before with this chain, nice pool and hot-bath, and a very big and diverse breakfast.  But the most important thing was the service. Especially Jenifer who was at the front desk every evening during our stay. She was very helpful, always asking how she can help and being very creative and resourceful. She went out of her way to help with every little thing we needed (and we needed quiet a few things...) She was amazing!  To top it all - she was even helpful after we left. We made a mistake with our reservation through Expedia, by booking our stay for the March instead of February. When we came back home and tried to cancel those reservation with expedia- we found out that we were facing a break wall. Jenifer again came to the rescue and spend some time talking to the service people at Expedia to get then to cancel our reservations. She was successful and if it wasn't for her we would not have been able to get those cancelled. Thank you Jenifer! (the rest of the staff was very nice and helpful as well- thank you too!)

93246297,barrie/ca/154980/650260/102787422.html,Super 8 Barrie,"The Super 8 Hotel Barrie, Ontario, Canada, is my home away from home. I have stayed at the Super 8 Hotel Barrie at least 300 times in the last 3 years as my employment requires substantial travel.  Firstly, the hotel is excellent, very clean and without the dedicated management and employees, this hotel would just be another run of the mill establishment. The employees make this hotel! The employees from the General Manager down to the Chamber Maids are well trained, professional, and knowledgeable and make it their business to know their quests by name, their families, their children and friends as well as their needs and requirements. My family often travels with me and we consider the Super 8 Barrie our home away from home. The General Manager Mirka runs a tight ship and my hat goes off to Lisa, Wilma, Heather, Marie, Big John, Charlie, Zenny and the rest of the staff which is too large to mention.  The Super 8 has a great breakfast which commences at 6:00 am and ends at 10:00 am. Heather and Marie look after the breakfast brigade and the food is always fresh and consists of sausage, scrambled eggs, boiled eggs, fresh waffles, fruit, cereal, toast, bagels, muffins, yogurt and fruit juices. The best breakfast in Barrie!    The hotel rooms are spacious, clean, bug free, with great fluffy towels, poufy pillows, clean washrooms and bath tubs. The furniture is new and the carpeting is very clean and often replaced. All the hallway carpeting was recently replaced and the walls are all clean and freshly painted. The hotel, to my estimation is approximately 5 years old, but due to the excellent and up kept condition, one would think that it was newly built and just recently opened! The parking lots are clean and the snow is always removed. The parking is free and spacious.   The hotel swimming pool and spa are very clean and well kept. The water in the swimming pool is crystal clear and the spa is spotless. At the pool and spa there are always plenty of pool towels available to dry off with. The public washrooms are also always clean. The lobby area is spacious and has a very nice gas fireplace completed with a couch and easy chairs. During the Christmas season the entire staff decorates the hotel with festive items to provide the guests with a homey feeling. Next to the front desk you will find a computer and printer for guest to use free of charge and to keep connected with loved ones at home as well as the workplace. The hotel also provides their guests with high-speed hard wired and wireless Internet access free of charge. The Super 8 Hotel Barrie is located very close to restaurants, department stores, super markets, Wal-Mart, gas stations, car washes and hospital.   The Super 8 Hotel employees go out of their way to make you feel at home and thus, this is why my family and I refer to it as “Home Away From Home”.

The room was very clean and the bunk beds were a bonus! The kids had their own sleeping area away from us and the free xBox made their day. The only drawback was that the only thing separating us from the children was a wall and a curtain for a door and the separate kid's TV was not hooked up to cable for regular TV watching. The great staff bent over backwards for our family. When the kids tried out the Xbox it was not working properly. So the next morning the front desk staff replaced the original xbox with a brand new one! Also, after we were almost home one of us realized that we had left a favourite pillow behind in our room. I contacted the front desk and they were more than happy to courier it to me. The pool was an added bonus for our young family. Was hoping it was a bit bigger since not too many people can be in it at the same time. Overall, our stay was fantastic and our kids are already asking when we are going back!

From the moment we parked our car on the property, our expectations were exceeded. The hotel looked new and very contemporary. The front desk staff greeted us with smiles and a warmth that is only felt when meeting family members. Our room was very spacious and clean and the hot breakfast (omelettes, sausages, waffles, etc.) was great! For dinner, we had countless options that were literally a 2 minute WALK from the hotel such as Boston Pizza, Jack Astors, Montanas and East Side Marios (which is located on the same property). We also walked across the street to pick up some things from Walmart, and were tempted to stop over at the Starbucks. There is just so much to do at this location. In terms of rooms, guest service and location, this hotel actually deserves a #1 ranking. Highly recommended!",5,positive

I was very impressed with the location of the hotel, it was right off the highway and walking distance from all major restaurants. All the staff members were very pleasant and extremely helpful. My room was huge and I just loved the duvet. The breakfast was also very tasty, especially the juicy sausages and fresh waffles. The coffee was the best part, it was perfect. I was so pleased by the hotel that I already made a reservation for my next business trip. 10/10",5,positive

Walked over to Boston Pizza and got a 15% discount because they have some special arrangement for Super 8 guests! Woke up in the morning and had the most wonderful breakfast!

I didn't have much knowledge about Barrie before visiting but the staff guided me to some amazing places within Barrie, including their beach, which is only about a 5 minute drive from the hotel. which brings me to my second point which is the location. it is located in the most convenient place that anyone can imagine; there is a Walmart right across the road; an LCBO right next to it; a Chapters right behind it. also, there are various options to eat wonderful meals from the many restaurants around this Super 8. Speaking of food, their morning breakfast is one of the best...it is definitely worth waking up in the morning to have their fresh made waffles and eggs.   Overall this was a wonderful experience and i definitely plan on going back many many times to visit.",5,positive
119990535,barrie/ca/154980/650260/119990535.html,Super 8 Barrie,"We stayed at the Super 8 over the Thanksgiving weekend (October 8, 2011). We had a 2 Queen room, which was very clean, nice decor and really, really comfortable beds! There was lots of room for our family of 4 including a baby. The washroom was clean with lots of towels and toiletries. The room included a coffee maker and refridgerator.  The staff were very friendly and quick to help out whenever we needed it. The hotel offers a free continental breakfast, which included pastries, breads, waffle maker, pre-made eggs, cereals and juices, milk, coffee, tea. Good location as it was close to the highway, restaurants and stores.  The only downfall was the pool. The hotel seemed brand new, put the pool was old, outdated and had lots of cracked tiles. It felt like the hotel had been built around an old pool. The jacuzzi was also very small with cracked interior. The water for both pools seemed a bit murky.   Overall, we had a great stay and would definatly stay here again!",4,positive

Also the staff responsible for breakfast were most cheerful at an early hour. I believe their names were April and Heather.

122688222,barrie/ca/154980/650260/122688222.html,Super 8 Barrie,"I stayed at the Super 8 in Barrie for 2 nights in one of their jacuzzi suites in early January of 2012. My stay was quite nice with no complaints and a few nice touches. Also it's worth noting that the information and pictures you see on their website are accurate.  POSITIVES: -Hotel and rooms were clean and beds had comfortable linens. 4 pillows on bed. -Free Wi-Fi -Location is a 2 minute walk to 4 restaurants-- East Side Mario's, Jack Astors, Mucho Burrito (a great place), and South Street Burger. There are several other restaurants such as Cora's you can get to without going back onto highway 400. These are about a 15 minute walk (on a sidewalk) or a 3 minute drive away. -Location is easy to get to, just off highway 400.  -There is a Chapters just behind the restaurant which has a Starbucks for anyone who needs a morning jolt. -The breakfast at the hotel is from 6-10 am and had waffles, bacon, eggs, and breakfast sausages the days I was there (midweek). -While I had little interaction with the staff other then check-in and out everything ran smoothly and they allowed us to have a late checkout on our final day. (Normal checkout is 11 am). -Coffee pot provided in room. -free parking -Room had separate shampoo and conditioner. (Not the terrible 2 in 1's some places have). -The front desk had complimentary cookies, suckers, and newspapers.  NEGATIVES: (To be fair I'm being VERY picky.) -The breakfast had a small bowl of fruit, most of which was unappealing. There was also no yogurt. In addition the coffee at the breakfast was quite watery, but that may have been an isolated thing. -The blanket on the bed was standard sized but I found it small for two people and there was no additional one in the closet. (Again I'm being picky). -The only sink was in the bathroom. -No robes.   WORTH KNOWING: -The ""jacuzzi suite"" said it had a ""two person jetted tub"" but I was confused as to whether this would be in the main room or in the bathroom and whether it would really be big enough for two people. The jacuzzi was in the main room itself which was great because you can watch TV from the tub. It was considerably larger than a normal tub, but would have been tight for two people. It was however luxurious for one person. There is also a full size shower (but no tub) in the bathroom. -The indoor pool was quite tiny but was not overly busy during our stay. -Overall the property strikes me as a great place for families to stay, especially with the complimentary breakfast. -This super 8 is apparently a ""Pride of Super 8"" property which supposedly means it meets higher standards than other Super 8's.

The breakfast was great (except they had no yogurt left @9am). Forget swimming as the pool is way too small and the jacuzzi is warm.   Good for a getaway.

123765002,barrie/ca/154980/650260/123765002.html,Super 8 Barrie,"Stayed here for one night on business based on a recommendation from a work colleague. Although this is a 3 star property for amenities, I give it full marks for value based on price, staff attitude, size of rooms and cleanliness.  This Super 8 is quite close to a Hwy 400 interchange and lots of box-store shopping and chain restaurants. There is lots of free parking out front of the hotel and I was immediately impressed by the number of front desk staff when I checked in at approximately 5:30 pm. There were 3 smiling faces who made the check-in very pain free.  My room was on the 3rd floor, about halfway down from the elevator, facing the parking lot and very quiet. The room was a suite and had two TVs, a small fridge and microwave. There was a separate sink outside the bathroom which would be handy for some. The bed was very comfortable with crisp white sheets. Wi-fi was complimentary.  The breakfast was the normal fare and decent. Eggs, sausages, cereal, breads, coffee and juice was all complimentary and while not gourmet, was reasonable.  All in all, for what I paid, I rate this hotel excellent value and would stay here a again.
 
 
 Room Tip:  Ask for a room away from the elevator if you would like a little more quiet.

That was certainly not the case in Barrie. The hotel was great and at an unbelievable value. While not full of fancy amenities it was remarkably suitable for our short-term family stay. Included WiFi, a small pool and hot tub and breakfast all at the price - unbelievable. The staff was very nice and helpful - more so than in hotels that cost twice as much. What took me most was how clean the hotel and room was. I can't stand staying at a dirty and grungy place. The Super 8 Barrie was pristine. If a stay in Barrie is what you need give the Super 8 serious consideration and don't be thrown by the price!

131934004,barrie/ca/154980/650260/131934004.html,Super 8 Barrie,My family was here for a weekend lacrosse tournament with friends and at night there was 6 adults and 3 children in our room talking and the kids were watching funny videos around 9-10 pm when customer service came up and shut our door which was only open about a foot so the door didn't slam every time and told us to be quiet cause there was complaints!!! Secondly we decided to go down to the breakfast area next to front desk at their request with other guests who were also down there having a few drinks and conversing!! Thirdly we decided to leave on our own accord at around 130 am and went right to bed! It was then as soon as we got into our room our phone rang and it was a guest complaining to us to keep quiet and stop partying but as my wife said my kids were sleeping and we just got to our room so she hung up!! 5 seconds later the phone rings again with the same woman yelling at my wife with profanity so my hung up on her again and it rang a 3 time! 10 seconds later a knock at our door and it is the night manager telling us to leave!! My friends came out who are all there and we were all dumbfounded by the attitude of this manager who would not listen to one word we said!! After all HE told us to go to the common room and watched us the whole time!! I said I am not leaving which is now 230 am and wake my kids up to pack after all I had a few drinks and also my wife so no one could drive and to top it off we WERE in bed already!! So he said he would call the cops which I said I would like that very much!! When they showed up this manager changed his story he said there was numerous complaints and that WE called and verbally abused the guest that phoned us!!! I mean how do we know what room someone is in right below us without calling the front desk first!!! The police then asked the manager to go back down to the front desk and wait cause he would not listen to reason so he could talk to us alone!! They convinced him to let us stay the night but to leave by 11am and I totally agreed because I have never had a experience like this at any hotel before and I have stayed at lots for tournaments!! Not to mentioned the whole team cancelled and move down the street because they couldn't believe the way we were treated!!!! Oh well that was lost revenue for them then and now for the future!!!! Because word gets around especially sports teams with big bookings!!!! And to top it off when 2 of my friends went to cancel their rooms they had to pay 50 dollar cancelation fee!!!!!!!! So sports teams you have been warned STAY AWAY!!!!!!,1,negative

I throughly enjoyed my stay, and would certainly recommend this hotel to anyone staying in barrie for a night or a long stay.

We booked through ASA because our team was attending the Barrie Ringetter Tournament. At check in we were required to sign documents stating we would be responsible for all damages in our rooms etc. and than it began. The hotel, I repeat is not ""TEAM FRIENDLY"". We were basically locked into to our rooms and the children were not allowed to leave without an adult. I have been involved in sports for over 30 years and never have encountered such rude and abnoxious staff. The rules were extreme and created a great deal of tension. ASA should only deal with hotel chains that are a little bit understanding about the environment of team stays. This year I have stayed at 3 hotels for team weekends and not had any issues. The staff at these establishments were helpful and pleasant. I would have left and found other accomodations had we not been strong armed by their unreasonable two night stay policy. This was a weekend I would like to forget. I have booked through ASA before and this is the first time for this type of treatment. We had a great group of people. We did our best to make sure that the children were behaving in an acceptable manner. I want to remind ASA that you are mainly serving groups with CHILDREN! My daughter wanted to find new accomodations and she no longer cared if she was able to stay with the others on her team. The notes left on our doors were rude and over the top. The approach from the staff was confrontational and inflamed the situation. Please keep this feedback in mind if you book other groups.

Room: The room was very nice and clean. This is a very new hotel and there was no wear and tear. The staff were very courteous and helpful.  Pool & Hot Tub: The pool was even smaller than expected based on the pictures that were on the website. I swear it wasn't more than 12 or 15 feet long. You couldn't really even swim in it. We arrived just after the 3 pm check in with the hopes of letting the kids go for a swim before dinner. The problem was it was closed because there was a birthday party in the pool area. I didn't realize that they book outside birthdays into their pool. There were at least 20 people running around and swimming in the very small pool. We couldn't get in until after dinner. By the way, the hot tub was about 4ft square and had a capacity of 3. We couldn't even have all 4 of us in at once.  Breakfast: We have stayed at Super 8 hotels a lot over the years (mostly in the US) and we always look forward to starting the day right with their hot breakfast. This was by far the worst breakfast at any of them. They promote the fact that they have a ""Superstart"" breakfast with eggs, bacon and waffles. The picture on the website even shows a couple of ""make your own"" giant waffle makers like other Super 8's have. My daughter and I were really looking forward to the waffles. When we got there, the waffles were cold, partially cooked ""eggo"" style frozen waffles in a warming tray. They also had eggs and bacon in the warming trays but they were both cold and looked like they were made hours before. The bacon all came out in one big clump. Needless to say, our morning didn't start off the right way.  Overall, the hotel was adequate for our needs. We got a good deal on the stow tubing at Snow Valley Resort. I'd recommend the hotel if it is just a stopover and you don't have too high of expectations for the pool and breakfast.",3,negative

We had two of our daughters with us but our son had a hotel with the team. The girls loved the bunk beds and the X-Box 360 (more game choice for younger kids would be a suggestion). When we needed extra towels they were brought to our room by a very friendly lady, advising us to call if we needed anything else. On the last night our son did not have a hotel with the team. Luckily we were able to get an air mattress delivered to us by another family arriving later in the weekend. The hotel was more that sold out due to the Winter Storm that hit Ontario on Fri. and Sat. They provided us with an extra pillow and blankets for our son. The pool was very little but if you read on the web page it does say that it is only 3 feet deep, so our expectations were not too high. The first morning the breakfast was amazing, but the next two mornings it was very disappointing. Since the waffles take a long time to prepare and they had a full hotel they decided to have the frozen waffles in a steamer. I am not sure why since the squash team had a breakfast To-Go and they were a large part of the hotel bookings. I would also like to thank the hotel staff for keeping the hallways quiet. I have been in hotels many times when there were teams in the halls yelling and screaming at all times through the night. This did not happen while we were in the hotel.

The hotel is located right off the 400, near the Molson Centre, so it's an ideal location. Within walking distance you have several (read: dozen?) restaurants, gas stations, etc. It's not far from Vaughan Mills, too, so you could easily make a weekend out of it with a Colts hockey game.   Inside the hotel - it's alright. The lobby was clean, the rooms were nice, and there was nothing to complain about. I wish the breakfast area had been larger, but it was busy that morning so not much could be done.   In the end, the surroundings make this hotel what it is. There's nothing wrong with this place, not by any stretch. It has what you need.

A free hot breakfast was also included in the price and the rooms were well kept. This place is surrounded by eateries. We ate at East Side Mario's (right next door) during our first night and at Jack Astors on the second night right across the street. The pool area also kept the kids happy. To make things even better, we had a great tournament. We will be back here with our team next year.

We stayed in one of their Jacuzzi suites and got the Do Not Disturb package which included wine and chocolates. Check-in was quick and efficient and our stay was great. At the time of booking, we did not know that a hot breakfast was included with our stay. What a bargain. The breakfast included hot items such as scrambled eggs, sausages and waffles. These waffles were not eggo waffles, but we had to pour the waffle batter in waffle irons and they were great! We had dinner at Montana's, which is located right behind the hotel and received a 15% discount just because we were Super 8 guests. The location of the hotel is phenomental. We would recommend this place to couples looking to have a getaway from the everyday.

This hotel was off of the first exit entering Barrie and a 30 second drive from the exit. The hotel looks new and way better than other Super 8's that we've stayed at. We receives a CAA discount on the already low rate and were impressed when told that a hot breakfast was also included which by the way was delicious. Staff was friendly and we are recommending this hotel to our friends. Keep up the great work and Merry Christmas.,5,positive

Right beside it is the LCBO and East Side Marios. The pool defintiely needs improvement, it is outdated and extremely small. I think it loses an entire star based on the pool.

Every time we called the front desk there was a short apology for the disturbance and we were told someone would be sent up to monitor the noise and tell other guest to be quiet. Yet nothing changed in noise level until they all seemed to go to bed around 1:45. Not good enough that we were made to feel like police by asking other guest to be quiet and then had nothing done.

After finally getting the key to our room (201- it is a suite) we went up to find an extremely warm room (to the point it was uncomfortable). We turned on the air in the unit which were very loud and took a long time to cool the room. The bathroom in the room also smelled very sour. We didn't spend much time in the room that evening and arrived back just to sleep. We soon discovered that we lucky enough to be near enough to the elevator to not only feel it, but also hear it every time it was used. It was so bad, it actually made the room vibrate and caused us to have a horrible night and leave early in the morning. We talked about how loud the room was with the cleaning staff as we were leaving and they indicated that this was a very common complaint from patrons about this room. We were shocked to learn that we had been stuck in a room that the hotel obviously knew wasn't up to par. When we brought our experience up with the front staff and mentioned the feedback from the cleaning staff, they indicated that they didn't have the ability to address our concerns and that we would need to call back and speak with the general manager (who wasn't there). Clearly feeling that the front staff was just passing the buck, we paid and left. We were only 40 minutes from home and didn't really need to stay at the hotel, but thought it would be nice to have fun night out. It obviously wasn't!!

I know Super 8's can be poor to average, but this is the nicest one I've stayed at and their rates aren't that of an economy chain. They have business style rooms that have a bedroom with a TV, and an adjoining room with a sofa, desk and a second TV. Perfect for ordering in some food and getting some work done. Previously when I checked in, i was always impressed how attentive the staff were. Friendly, and there wasn't anything they couldn't do for the guests. This visit i got a call previous to arriving from the front desk, noting that the old credit card i they had on file was no longer valid. Fine - i gave them the new one. I noticed someone had dropped some food on the elevator floor - and it had been there a while. Then when i asked for something other than the paper cups they had in the rooms i was told i could go across the street to the dollar store. Both the desk staff were really disinterested in anything other than they were doing. I'm looking for another hotel next trip - even if it's a higher rate.

I went downstairs to let the front desk clerk know as we wanted it on record we were not responsible for the mess in the bathtub. She made note of it, in the computer system and informed me a manager would call me on Monday. We paid for a room with a tub, and were not able to use it. We should not have to pay full price. Also, there was a kids hockey team staying in the hotel, and while I realize asking kids to sit in a hotel room and be quiet is just not possible, at the same time having to listen to kids for hours on end running up and down the hallways playing hockey with the goalie nets set up is also not being respectful to the other customers in the building. This would go on till 11 o'clock at night and when the kids would go to bed the parents would come out and drink and mingle in the hallway. They did this right in front of our room.

Yelling screaming, running, no parents in sight. Serving themselves at breakfast (extremely hot waffle machine?!?) and making a huge mess.  I think Super * may want to invest in a ""We are no responsible for children blah blah "" sign.  Also, I have 12 mystery bug bites on my body.

Other than that, the room was spacious, clean, and had a mini fridge which was convenient. In addition, the hotel is centrally located with many restaurant options, shopping and activities within minutes of the hotel. I would personally recommend Pie pizzeria, a 5-minute drive from the hotel; it is a sit-in family restaurant that was featured on Food Network's ""You gotta eat here."" Overall, a fairly seemless experience other than the minor faults which I hope will be fixed in the future. Would stay again.",3,negative

There were plenty of restaurants within walking distance along with some shops to browse through (Pier One, Home Outfitters) and many more around the corner. Staff was very pleasant and always greeted us with a smile. We booked ahead and saved on two great rooms - the Standard double Queen and the Executive king suite. The suite was the perfect place to do some catching up with plenty of room and comfortable seating.  Oh...and the paper cups provided in the room are much better than plastic while being environmentally conscious at the same time!!!

The room was very comfortable, quite spacious for our little family, really enjoyed the microwave and fridge in the room, they came in handy, also my husband really enjoyed the coffee maker in the morning, but hardly used it due to the delicious breakfast downstairs. The only bad thing about the trip was that I left my wallet there, fortunately the staff emailed me/facebooked me to let me know, 10 mins. after I checked out, that was very great, and I got to visit the hotel again. Another great thing, my son learned how to swim, thanks to the great pool.

As a precaution, we booked the jacuzzi suite, as we figured we would need pampering after exploring all day! It was the best thing EVER!!! The breakfast was more than adequate, with quite a large choice considering. The staff were really nice and helpful. The only downside was the rubbish truck coming round at 04-30am!!! Apparently, they have spoken to them about the time before but to no avail! Apart from that, I thought it was real value for money!

I don't usually stay at Super 8 properties (I generally prefer higher end hotels) however this one seemed better than average, and was over $300 cheaper (for the week) than the Holiday Inn Express / Hampton, and looked *almost* as nice.  The location is fantastic. Very easy to get to Highway 400, even at busy times of the day. There are plenty of great places to eat within a 15 minute drive (or less!). There is an East Side Mario's on the property that will deliver room service if you wish.  Also in the immediate area is a Walmart and a Sobey's, in case you are are looking for snack or toiletry items.  The check-in process was easy and friendly. I was pre-placed in a room on a non-pet floor just as I had requested in the online booking. The check-in clerk gave me all the info on pool, breakfast hours, etc quickly and efficiently.  Once I got to my room I inspected it for cleanliness. The room was very clean and generally in good condition, but the hotel is showing some signs of age. For example a crack in the wall above the door, dings in the wall from bumped with luggage, etc. Nothing that was a problem -- just little things.  The room was nice, large bathroom, nice little counter for coffee/tea etc, comfortable mattress, 3 pillows per bed, a nice TV, a small table with 2 chairs, etc.   There were only two cleanliness problems with the room -- 1. the drawers in the dresser had ""bits"" of ""stuff"" in them. (I didn't use the drawers). No reason those couldn't have been clean. and 2. the bottom of my table had some gross sticky stuff on it -- which I discovered when I reached the pull the table out from the wall.  Otherwise the room was totally acceptable and I was glad to be home each day.  Breakfast had good hours, served in the lobby. Each day there was coffee, eggs (either scrambled or some sort of cheese filled ones), sausage, toast/english muffins/bagels/muffins, waffles, orange juice/cranberry juice and cold cereals (including 'kid treat' cereal like fruit loops) Food was always hot and fresh.   The breakfast area had lots of room to sit, although it did fill up on some days. (Breakfast was complimentary)  Amenities - the wifi was excellent for most of my trip, but the last few days it was almost totally unusable. We also had a bus load of people (literally) show up that day, so I assume it was just over saturated.) The ""pool"" is the smallest pool I've ever seen in a hotel.",4,positive

She took pictures as we did and said she could not get us clean sheets cause house keeping was gone. We slept in second bed, no manager but full bill under the door.

The staff continue to be friendly and accommodating; we certainly appreciate the breakfast lady letting us grab a very early breakfast to get to our trial by 7:00am. The rooms were clean and the air conditioning worked fine. One night the cable was off but that was Rogers issue and no problem to us at all. We were very satisfied with the interior of the hotel and our 4 night stay there and will rebook again for next year:)))  One suggestion we would like to make is that the grounds need some sprucing up. The garbage needs to be picked up from the containers and the garbage garage was smelly if parked near-by. The garbage had leaked out by the side door where it had been temporarily placed and we had to be careful not to track it into the hotel throughout the weekend. The shrubbery and landscaping also needs to be a bit better maintained or it will look unkept. Just some of the things we noticed that had changed sice last year's stay.   We enjoyed our stay, certainly appreciate it being dog friendly, and will be back, thank you.

The accommodation was nicely appointed and was competitively priced.The staff were friendly and helpful. All good things you would expect and satisfied to return, but nothing really to write a review about - although I was pleasantly surprised for the value. What happened after our stay that is worth sharing.  I left my sons favourite stuffed toy behind. ""Bertie"" is special to him for many obvious reasons, but he is special to the family for reasons that he is too little to understand. Jamie at Super 8 Barrie took ownership of getting Bertie safe and packaged ready for a pick up I arranged with a well-known parcel service. The parcel service failed miserably on many levels. Jamie was committed to get Bertie home that she took Bertie with her off shift and had him delivered Expresspost through Canada Post on her own time, with her own money. I broke down after we got off the phone with gratitude for such wonderful caring people. If the staff do this for a guest after their stay, it can only be imagined how accommodating they would be during a stay. Qualities hard to come by and cannot be rated in value as it is priceless. Yes, Bertie arrived - thanks to Jamie.

We were attending a family event south of Barrie so the Super 8's location worked well for us. Plenty of parking, check in was efficient, staff was always courteous & friendly, our room was clean, the bed was comfortable and the wi-fi worked fine. That is, the wi-fi worked fine when signing on with Internet Explorer, could connect but could not sign on via Mozella/Firefox.  The hotel is pet friendly and on checking in we noticed that several guests were taking advantage of that. We asked if we could have a room that was not used by pets and were assigned a corner room on the top (4th) floor.   We only had one common wall but noisy neighbours next door. I think they were part of a big group that was there to party. At about 11:30 PM we called the front desk for the second time to complain about the noise next door. No idea what action the staff threatened but it worked. The noise stopped a few minutes later and we had no further problem.  There is only one small elevator for guest use and it is very slow. We found it quicker to use the stairs when descending but had to wait a while when going up to the room.  The breakfast was good and we appreciated the free coffee that seemed to be available 24/7.

It's also just off the highway near a bunch of box stores and restaurants. Bunkbed suite has a second small room instead of a second bed. Bunkbed room also had a TV with an Xbox connected to it, but no cable. The room was a little run down in the bunkbed area - lots of scuffs on the walls from the ladder being moved around and kids being kids. We read a lot of reviews that the hotel is new, but I don't think this is the case. Could have been that our room catered to kids - so was a little on the rundown side.

But I must comment ,that the drapes in all the rooms I have been in thus far, do not appear to fit the window width, thus, lacking complete privacy ( and I feel the need to frequently close the drapes since they don't meet in the middle).. Also, the breakfast sausages taste cheap slimy and tasteless.. please consider bacon or ham as an alternative.",5,positive

I know Super 8s can sometimes be a bit of a crapshoot, but I have stayed here twice and have an overall good feeling about it. My only real complaint is that the beds are far too firm for me. This is good for some people and not for others. A good mattress topper would go a long way toward greater comfort. The front desk staff are way beyond average. They really do make the stay memorable.",4,positive

I got my credit card statement to see I was charged an extra 150 dollars when I called the hotel to Inquire they told me it was extra housekeeping fees due to smoking in the room I explained that my girlfriend and i don't smoke and could have been a previous guest the guest service manager told me ""I should have complained"" again we didn't have time to look around the room we did smell smoke but again chose not to complain cause we wanted a good weekend the guest service manager told me "" her hands were tied, that the housekeeper said we smoke in there , she then said the general manager would contact me"" it is now oct 5 and have yet to hear from him. After reading the negative reviews I can see I'm not the only one with this issue also the general manager responses to the comments, his lack of empathy and lack if customer service he rather lash out on the guest rather then use the negative comment to improve his establishment",1,negative

251719343,barrie/ca/154980/650260/251719343.html,Super 8 Barrie,"So I stayed here on the 24th of January, understanding from previous nights stay at another hotel, that Barrie hotels were packed with hockey tournaments this weekend.   I stayed on the 4th floor in a king size room. It was spacious and I found the room to be clean and the bed to be fairly comfortable.   There seemed to be a party going on in the room next door starting at around 4pm which went unaddressed ( I did not call) until it quieted down around 8pm  At around 3am I was awoken to very loud music, banging, and drunk people yelling next door. I called the front desk and they said they would send someone up. Around 25 minutes later someone came to talk to them.   At 615 am my phone rang for a wake up call which I did not request. It turned out to be a horrible nights sleep  Upon check out I asked why I was given a wake up call. And was informed that they write down every request and that some one must have wanted me awake. I said that I was traveling alone. She didn't seem to care and just said sorry.   I checked out and was going to find another hotel for the night. But it turns out that on Sunday's the rates drop back down again. The super 8 is located close to where I needed to be so I decided to give it another shot. I stayed again on Jan 25th  This time I booked a queen size suite on the first floor.   The room was clean and comfortable. The only complaint would be the hum heard from the electrical/ maintenance closet directly outside the room. It was annoying while watching TV, however it didn't bother me while in the bedroom.   Overall, this hotel is in a great location, close to restaurants, shopping and the highway. The hotel is clean and the beds are comfortable. The breakfast was adequate and the waffle iron was a nice touch. The customer service needs work as when you pay for a night of sleep in a hotel you should be guaranteed not to be bothered.

We had to add an extra night onto our previously booked two nights, which the hotel staff was aware may happen. our rate jumped from $80/night to $160/night because it was a Valentines special? Nobody thought to make us aware of this special before.  As an $80/night hotel I don't have to many complaints, the room was clean and the free breakfast was ok.   As a $160/night hotel it was horrible, we were first off told that there was nothing they could do about the rate and that we should have booked the 3rd night when we originally booked (which we would have, had we been made aware the rate would be doubling) there was a kids sports team also staying and they were up until all hours slamming doors and running up and down the halls. We did try to book another hotel but it was the best of what was available in Barrie that night.

Front desk provided me with clean sheets. Jacuzzi tub was sketchy in that it did not look very clean. Shower was similar. Next two nights we were in a double queen room. Ants welcomed us (staff was quick to come and spray some ""pet safe"" product and we didn't see any more). Toilet was very loose and rocking and the tub faucet wasn't fixed to the wall - spigot was screwed to the copper pipe and that's it. Found hair in my bed that was not mine. Walls are paper thin, sound even travels through the floors too. The phone rang next door and I thought it was my phone until I heard the woman next door answer it and could hear her conversation. My bar fridge smelled horrible - like someone left an ashtray sitting in it. My daughter put her chocolate bar in it because of the ants and it was inedible the next day as it had absorbed the smell of the fridge.  The pool is a fancy puddle - very small and 3ft deep. Disappointing when you show up with a hockey team and the kids look forward to swimming.  Breakfast was nothing special. Would like to see more fresh fruit and perhaps yogurt available.

The toilet was also not cleaned very well, the toilet paper holder was dirty, and the hair dryer was coated in dust. When I tried to talk to the front desk about it they cut me off and said that the rooms are inspected after cleaning. They obviously arnt inspected well.

Quiet time starts at 10:30pm however with a group of teenagers (possibly hockey players) the opportunity to run the halls and up and down the stairwell was too much to resist. After numerous calls to the front desk the activity finally subsided about 1am. We tried to use the pool as well however the chlorine was so strong upon entering the room we both had to leave. I understand with the March break there were many more people in the hotel that they needed to keep levels up, there was an excess used that day. Rooms were good. Beds comfortable however maid service on the last morning left a little to be desired. Garbage from take out was not removed. Beds were made but were not neat and tight like usual.

East side Marios in the parking lot, Chapters, mcdonalds, wendy's and other stores 2 minutes walk away, Timmies 5 minute walk... plenty of options.  Free Breakfast was good, I expected cereal, costco muffins and coffee, but was very surprised to see eggs, sausage and hashbrowns, with make your own pancakes with muffins, toast, bagels, cereal. For a free breakfast it was among the best I've had at a hotels for free. Everyting hot/warm, and good tasting.  In summary, good clean modern hotel, at a great price, great for families.

The walls do seem thin, but I tend to find people are often inconsiderate of others in hotels - kids allowed to run/jump down the halls etc.  Note for those using Booking.com - the taxes are not included in your final shown rate.

It had a queen sized bed and a bunk bed in an alcove that has a curtain ""door"". The kids were disappointed to find that the tv in their area wasn't operational. Apparently, there used to be a gaming system to use with the tv but no more. And they haven't hooked up the cable or a DVD to the tv either. Did hear some thumping from above but only once and it wasn't too late. The ""bar"" fridge in the room was small and had no freezer compartment and was not very efficient/effective in cooling. Be forewarned that the pool is very small and shallow which might be ideal for younger kids and non-swimmers. Also, there were only 3 pillows on the Queen bed and two of them were very soft. We hunted through all the drawers and looked in the closet area for another but didn't find one. We then asked at the front desk and apparently got the last available pillow. Supposedly they were in ""short supply"" throughout the hotel. Overall, though, it was an enjoyable stay.",4,positive

For disabled travellers, there was a grab rail by the toilet and another in the walk-in shower. There is no grab rail between the toilet and shower which may be the reason the towel bar is pulled off the wall. The shower seat was either broken or had loose legs. It served as a place to put soap and shampoo and wash cloth because there is no ledge or place to put these. Breakfast was good with sausage and cheese omelet. Receipt was delivered to room during the night advising to leave keys in room, no need to check out, which is a sensible management decision. Staff were attentive to me walking with 2 canes on wet floors (it was raining). The room had a door to an adjoining room, which was for pets.

301806287,barrie/ca/154980/650260/301806287.html,Super 8 Barrie,"In the past we have stayed in this hotel and were very very pleased. The room rates, quality of the hotel and service were wonderful. However it has been probably a year and a half since we last stayed and I must say that the hotel has become very very run down.   The first room we were given was definitely a very basic room with two queen beds. The first impression of the room was that it was definitely an economy hotel - very sparse, low/hard beds, walls very marked up, and it didn't smell very nice. The pillows were terrible - in fact the pillow cases were too big for the shabby pillows. I was determined to make the most of it until I found long black hair on the bed and pillow area. My husband went to the front desk to request another room. After being told there was absolutely no other rooms and that since we had booked online and had a ""deal"" on our room that they could not change us to another room. (I must admit this lead me to believe that since we had received a ""good deal"" on our room as I booked through my Ontario College of Teachers website - that we had been given one of there lower quality rooms) My husband explained that this was not acceptable and that we would like our money back as we would be changing hotels. They eventually found us another room. This room was slightly better. The room was still quite run down and once again there was hair on the pillow cases - quite a bit of hair on several pillows cases. At this point our children were tired and hungry so I agreed to deal with it since it was just one night. I did go to the front desk to ask for fresh pillow cases and explained that the old ones had hair on them. The staff at the front desk gave me new pillow cases and asked that I bring the old ones back to her. **In the end, even after changing the pillow cases, the pillows were so poor and unclean that I went across the street to Home Outfitters and bought new pillows and pillow cases.  One of the reasons we stayed in the hotel was so our kids could swim and burn off some energy. Well the pool area was just as run down as the rest of the rooms. The paint was peeling off the ceiling and walls, the plastic covering on the railing on the pool steps was off in several places, there were no pool towels and the water was cloudy. ** Note the water in the pool is only 3 ft deep so if you have older kids wanting to actually swim and play - pick another hotel **  As for the rest of the room - the ceiling in the bathroom by the shower had clearly had water damage and they had done a very poor job of fixing it, the walls in the bathroom near the toilet needed a good wipe and the floor under the sink needed a good cleaning.   The bedding definitely needs to be freshened up - clearly it has seen better days. The top sheet/duvet cover has definitely been around for a long long time as it was very well worn and the actual duvet was stained. I did not like that they just use a flat sheet on the bottom instead of a fitted sheet. The flat sheet barely covered the top of the mattress and didn't want to stay in place.   I have to say I was just so disappointed that we were ending our family vacation with such a poor experience. We don't require a fancy hotel room but I do expect it to be clean.   It is sad to see what was once such a nice hotel and a family favourite- is now so run down and poorly kept.  I would like to end on a positive note - the staff were very friendly and went out of their way to make you feel welcome.",2,negative

I checked at the Super 8 and they accommodated me and my pooch. They gave me a ground floor room right beside a door to the outside to make it easy to take my dog out. The room was very clean and comfortable. The room looked like the hotel was brand new which it is not. The queen size bed was extremely comfortable. Totally satisfied with the room and price. The breakfast available at 6 am was great. I did not use it but the indoor pool looked very inviting.",5,positive

Having stayed in hotels in various parts of the world I can safely say that the Super 8 in Barrie was better than some 4 star hotels I've had the misfortune to stay in. The rooms were very clean and comfortable and the staff were always helpful, nothing was ever too much trouble for them, which is exactly what you need when you're thousands of miles from home and have forgotten something important!  The breakfasts were also great and since they are included in the price, excellent value. With the choice of eggs, bacon/sausages, freahly made waffles, coffee, toast, fruit juice, cerals etc what's not to like..

Breakfast is one of the better ones that I've seen. Front desk staff are clued-out sometimes. Asked for an extension to my stay at the hotel from my room, as I was leaving in the morning, and she actually put me on hold for 2 minutes. I had to hang-up and call the front desk again to ask, ""is it really that complicated to extend my stay"", and she did it in less than the time she put me on hold. I guess they're understaffed in the morning, and too busy to handle things without multi-tasking? Not a big deal, but a bit surprising when you're asking for something routine like this.",5,positive

Although the room was pretty basic, the bed and pillows were very comfortable. I found it difficult to work as there was only a small round table instead of a desk, but I was able to manage. I did, however, experience some issues was the bathroom. There was a lot of hair in the sink and shower. I understand that there may be an odd hair here and there, but the sink especially contained a lot of hair. Breakfast was ok. There wasn't a whole lot of variety, but it was pretty decent considering the reasonable price of the room. Overall, I would say that it was very reasonably priced.

The price is right, the rooms are big and clean, sleep quality and shower is nice and it's located very close to the highway.   Most hotels have a 'save the linens' or 'reuse' the towels sign for the purpose of conservation but unfortunately that effort ends when it comes to the food served for breakfast which includes meat and dairy (most destructive to the environment and huge water waste). I encourage Super 8 to expand on their non-meat offerings for their Breakfast by replacing sausages with Vegan Sausages (Yves, morningstar etc) and expanding their oatmeal with add-ons like walnuts and raisons and finally offering Vegan Pancakes instead of ones made with eggs and dairy (it's really easy)  (check onegreenplanet (.org) or watch cowspiracy for more details and inspiration). DId you know i could shower continuously for six months and use the same amount of water as was used to produce your tray of sausages (meat) in the breakfast area each morning.  Thanks as always, i will continue coming back and recommending this hotel!   There is Free-unlimited Wifi for all my devices (THANKS for not putting a limit)   There are a few restaurants within walking distance and a shopping centre nearby too.

Once we arrived, I had a sinking feeling that the hotel was in disarray. In the entrance, the carpets were dirty and looked as though they hadn't been cleaned in a very long time. We received our room (a queen bed with bunk beds) but didn't have a lot of time to view it since our kids were aching to go to the pool. In the pool area, there were no towels, so my husband had to go to the front desk to ask for some. A lady brought us four. Quickly, more and more people came to swim, having no towels when they came out. Once again, someone had to advise the staff. Getting back to the room, we noticed a variety of things that made us decide to cancel our second night and book another hotel. Several holes in the walls, no clip on the back of the remote to hold the batteries, hair in the queen bed and on the top bunk of the bunk beds, writing and scribbles all over the guestbook, a dingy chair with a hole in it and lots of wear, a hole in the ceiling where the sprinkler system is, and a dead ladybug on the window sill. The breakfast experience was awful. One member of the staff was responsible for running around replacing juice and helping guests navigate older machines that needed shaking in order to work properly. I felt so badly for her.  We are not a very picky family and have stayed in a myriad of similarly priced hotels with far better cared for rooms.

While it was close to many amenities I am afraid it fell short for my business travel needs. The room was OK nothing special but clean. There were no USB jacks or plugs close to the bed. I am sure other business travelers do not sit in the stiff chairs to work in the evening but settle into bed to work on their computers. Unfortunately there was no place to plug in ! This was definitely a big design faux pas, especially this day and age when so many people young and old are plugged in to many devices. Whether it be for a wake up alarm on your phone or your lap top it is needed. Also wifi had to be rebooted many times so connection was lost a few times.  The room was also cold so I tried to turn on the heat. The wall unit did not work so unfortunately it was a chilly night. I was able to turn off the fan but that was it.   I was awake in the morning around 7 and noticed that they started cleaning the rooms above and beside me at 7:30-7:45 ! I think that is a bit early to start running vacuum cleaners etc......

They have a nice grassy area behind the hotel where a dog can play on a long leash. The hotel is well kept. Everything worked in room 202. Bed was comfy. Bathroom is small but has everything you need including a good spraying shower. My room, although I didn't need them had a separate room with bunk beds. Awesome for a couple with young kids. Great value for the money. Will stay here again. Rena at the front counter is super helpful.

384389217,barrie/ca/154980/650260/384389217.html,Super 8 Barrie,"We stayed here for only one night - with 2 small children. I'll start off with the good as there was more good than bad, but the bad points are hopefully easily fixable for management:  GOOD: Location - close to many restaurants and shopping - we loved that we had many restaurant choices within walking distance - also an LCBO right next door was a welcomed sight after a long drive!  Rooms - we came to the Super 8 because they had a room with a bunk bed which we can't find anywhere else unless we go to a super pricey theme resort in Niagara Falls. We liked that we had a fridge and microwave in the room.  Quiet - I liked that there were many signs throughout the hotel making sure everyone knew quiet time was after 10pm. We didn't hear a peep from anyone else all night!  Amenities - we liked that there was a free breakfast, pool, hot tub and everything we asked the front desk for they had, which was very much appreciated!  The bad:  The room itself felt used - worn down furniture, scribbling and stains on the walls of the kids room, and some nasty curly hair left all over the floor of the bathroom (by the time this was discovered we had settled into the room and I didn't want to ask to move rooms and disrupt everyone). My kids were also very disappointed that the TV/Games console that we had in the midland super 8 was not in the room - but the bracket that used to hold the TV was still there.  The pool - VERY small, and only three feet deep. We lucked out and had it to ourselves for 1/2 hour but as soon as another family arrived it felt crowded and awkward.   WIFI - was free, but very slow and spotty.  Overall, for the price, and the location, it was okay. It would be much better though with some better housekeeping in the bathroom and in the kids room. Perhaps an easier to wipe down wall material would be better for the kids room? To see it the way that it was made it feel dirtier than it probably was. The pool is not the easiest thing to fix but seemed like a waste of money to have there being that it's so small and requires a lot of upkeep! We would probably stay here again in the future but hopefully management sees these comments and makes some immediate changes in their housekeeping and room maintenance practices!",3,negative

Super-friendly and efficient. There was one young woman who seemed less aware than the rest, but my guess is she's relatively new. On the last night of my stay the room next to mine had left the TV playing really, really loud, and the woman at the front desk took care of it swiftly and with no trouble.  2, The building itself is always clean and presentable. The suite cleaners are very good at what they do and when you first enter a room, they're consistently clean and ready welcome you to relax.  3, The price is fair. I always book with the hotel itself and I find the rates to be very reasonable. Typically I get the queen jacuzzi suite and it's the most reasonable price of any I've tried.  The Bad: 1, Wifi. Wow, the wifi was bad this time. It never reached a full signal and I couldn't load pages about 50% of the time. Very frustrating, I really wish there was a movie-buying option on the room TV.  2, Breakfast. It's awesome that breakfast is included. Saves a lot of time and money. But even with the waffle station, it feels like the options are very limited. The eggs were only in omelette form, which I really don't like, the cereal was all really bland and boring. It's also easy to crowd the space, and there's no fruit to be seen. But man, those waffles are good.  Final word: keep the service as awesome as always.

The tub is a little wider than most hotel tubs and the shower head is a multi jet head. Would be so much better if hotels installed hand held shower heads. There is a curved shower curtain, which I prefer since it keeps the curtain from touching your body. Next to the sink area is the closet that has hangers, iron, ironing board and shelf. Continuing past this hall area is the bedroom. There is a door that can be closed and locked to separate it from the rest of the suite. The bedroom in this room includes a very comfortable King bed, 2 night stands with wall lights, a luggage stand, floor lamp, LG television, TV Stand that has 3 drawers, microwave, and mini fridge. The heating/a/c unit is in this room but does a great job heating/cooling all rooms. Unlike most hotels, there are ample electrical outlets. There is free WiFi that was very quick, indoor pool and hot tub open 7am to 10:30pm, workout room, breakfast area with free hot breakfast buffet 6am to 10am, meeting rooms were available, faxing and copy service available at the front desk, cribs and cots available for $10, coin laundry 24/7 on ground floor, ice/vending on 1st floor. The hotel sits next door to East Side Mario's where you can walk a few steps and pick up a to go order or dine in, or you can pay $5 and they will bring it to you! Wendy's is across the street. Within walking distance are hundreds of stores and restaurants as this is the Mall area. I got dinner from East Side Mario's and not only was it ready in 10 minutes, the people were extremely nice. The food was delicious. I had to walk through the Lobby area of this hotel several times while bringing my things in, getting dinner, checking things in my van, etc and each time I was greeted with a smile and you could see they were very aware and waiting to see if you needed anything. I am very pleased with this hotel. I only wish every Super 8 was this nice.",5,positive

We were going to be spending time at Casino Rama and Wasaga Beach and this location was right smack dab in the middle. All the staff were very friendly and helpful including the housekeepers. The room was clean and the bedding fresh. Without prompting they put us in a room on the ground floor near an exit which was a perfect location to take our pooch out for his walk. The breakfast is the best of its kind and although we slept in, and arrived late, there was still plenty available. There were shops and restaurants all around, an East Side Mario's right next door, but still in a very quiet out of the way location. The only drawback was the very shallow pool, 3 feet deep. A pool is one of the highlights for us when we travel but with aging knees we were unable to stoop to enjoy the full effects of the water.

The hotel was very clean, and the staff was friendly and attentive. I was also impressed by the quality of the shower in the room, it was much better than a lot of the places I have stayed in before.  The hotel rooms were a reasonable size, and the beds were comfortable. It was nice to see a fridge and a microwave in the rooms, although I didn’t use either. Despite being close to a major road, the noise in the hotel was minimal.  The hotel provided a complimentary breakfast. The food was the downside of the hotel. The quality was average, and definitely nothing to write home about. As I was staying with customers, we did eat in the hotel, but if I had been on my own I would have eaten somewhere else. The eggs provided were tasteless and bland, and there was only one other hot option available. The waffle maker was a good touch however. On the first morning I was there the hotel only provided paper plates and plastic cutlery. However, this could be due to the large number of children staying in the hotel (it was a Sunday morning). On subsequent days, proper plates and cutlery were provided.  The hotel was near several restaurants including East Side Marios (which shares the same parking lot), Jack Astors and Montanas. There was also a Tim Hortons, McDonalds and Starbucks nearby.  Would I stay here again? Maybe, it suited my needs on the trip. The hotel was good value for money, but they need to improve the quality of the breakfast.",3,negative

75043975,barrie/ca/154980/650260/75043975.html,Super 8 Barrie,"Having never thought I'd stay at a Super 8, I ended up booking this hotel with my son in mind as they have ""Kids Suites"" that include Xbox and bunkbeds. He was not disappointed in the least. We picked up our games at the desk on check-in and the bunkbeds even had Harry Potter bedspreads on them. Check-in was smooth and easy. Desk clerks in the evening and in the morning were both wonderful and attentive to all questions, etc. They have a great breakfast in the morning and their pool is also very nice! This property is in a busy section close to food (though I would suggest avoiding the Boston Pizza at all costs due to its horribly loud atmosphere even on a Monday night and its terrible customer service!) and shopping and feels very safe. Also, our stay was very, very quiet the entire time we were there.   The only negatives I found with this hotel is the rather steep hold they put on your credit card on check-in ($250.00CDN). Our bank puts a hold on our account for a week once a merchant puts a hold on the account, so even after we were home and Super 8 had lifted their own hold, our money was still tied up through our own bank. But, not to worry, a quick call to Super 8 and their GM, Mirka, got my bank a fax stating that Super 8 had dropped their hold, which allowed our bank to also drop the hold on their end. Now that's customer service that doesn't even end once you leave the property!   Only other negative issue I found with this hotel was the room quality wasn't superior. There was a small hole in the wall above our door and the furnishings in the room were well-used. The kids' room such as it is, was very small and totally taken up with the X-box station and bunkbeds with only a curtain to serve as a door. But this is more a parent's perspective than a kid's I think because our son was really into having his ""own space"" and the 'coolness' of bunkbeds and game station. For the price we paid, the customer service, and all the other amenities this hotel provides, it was money well spent and I wouldn't hesitate to book in again!",5,positive

Seeing the good reviews on here about this Super 8 I decided to book it, and I'm very glad that I did. This is definitely one of the better Super 8's out there (as we did stay in a couple others across the country following this stop, but they weren't that great.)  The location is excellent. Located close to the highway, but not close enough to be noisy over the night. There was plenty of places to eat nearby for dinner. A short ~10 min drive to downtown Barrie. I got up early in the morning and enjoyed the short drive to Centennial Park and snapped plenty of beautiful pictures of the Barrie sunrise. Our stay was not long enough for us to witness much in terms of service, but the staff was definitely very friendly and greeted us with smiles.   Rooms were good. They are everything you expect from a sub-$100 hotel. Beds were comfortable (I would think anything is comfortable after a long day's drive), bathroom was clean, TV with plenty of channels. There was absolutely nothing I could complain about. There wasn't any wifi in my room, but the front desk was more than happy to lend me with an ethernet cable. I think the highlight of the stay, though, was the breakfast the next morning. Everything from cereal, juices, bagels, toast.. to eggs, bacon, sausages. From all the places I stayed throughout our trans-Canada trip, this was definitely THE BEST.. and it was free! Oh, and did anyone mention the DIY waffle-maker?

83731045,barrie/ca/154980/650260/83731045.html,Super 8 Barrie,"On Monday evening, September 27, 2010 I arrived at Super 8 Barrie after a long time behind the steering wheel. The young gentleman behind the front desk (whose name I later learned was ""Charles"") met me with a big smile and a very pleasant word of welcome. He recongized that I was very tired and without a second thought he offered me a fresh Chocolate chip cookie. That doesn't sound like much but after a long day, a senior like me couldn't help but respond positively. After being asked my name and if I had a reservation, he very efficiently went about the process of completing my reservation. All the time, l he talked with me and laughed with me; and as a result, from the first minute of my arriving in your hotel, I was just made to 'feel much better'. He gave me ideas about where to eat, and asked if there was anything I needed, to just call down and he would take care of it., What a welcome change to be met in such a great way. I just want to thank Charles for the way he treated my wife and me; also I want to compliment whoever hired this young man because he certainly is an asset to your chain. In fact, during my one night stay-over, I had chance to speak with several other employees about this or that and found everyone seemed to share the attitude I have mentioned above. I hope to meet Charles again and thank him for making an ""old guy"" like me feel important and comfortable. I wish there was some way to reward this kind of man because he did his job, yes 110%, but the things he added are rare and should be recognized as such. Give him my kindest regards.   Thank you George R Bell, PO Box 337, Corunna, ON N0N 1G0 519-862-3096",5,positive

The hotel room was well appointed, extremely clean, the staff were very friendly. My 5 year old is an active child and the pool/whirlpool/fitness room were a wonderful luxury. In addition, the staff was very accommodating when family visits occurred. My visitors were welcomed with warmth and smiles. The wifi was quick and always available and the breakfast buffet was well stocked and fresh. I cannot recommend this hotel highly enough. The location is somewhat on the edge of town but only a 20$ cab ride to the city centre. And while my son and I were on foot, there are a remarkable number of stores and amenities within walking distance. It is located just off the main highway so my visiting relatives found it very accessible. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Fairfield and would definitely stay again.

Small nitpick--breakfast is complimentary and starts at 6:30 but attendant didn't have everything in place each day until closer to 6:45. This is too late if you need to be out the door and off to client visits by 7:30.

They have 24-hour complimentary tea, coffee, hot chocolate and juice.   The only reason why I gave it a 4-star instead of 5 is because the AC in our room didn't work and we didn't have a good sleep as it was too hot.   We had a wheelchair accessible room which was nice and big but it was located above the main entrance and you could hear people talking when they went out for a smoke.

So my husband said he would book it later. My husband ended up booking through expedia or somewhere similar. When we arrived my husband asked if we could upgrade to a suite since we were having family come to visit they said they were booked solid and we did not ""reserve through them"". The next night I asked if they were still booked solid, she said ""no"" , so I asked if we could pay the difference and upgrade I was told no because they had no idea how much we had paid, and we did not book through them?? Went to go for a swim no towels, no toilet paper in the bathroom where the pool is. I think they forgot to clean our room because there was a huge rush around 5:00 because the girl was leaving. Would not stay here again...not very helpful when asked a question and if you are looking for the front desk staff they will be sitting in the breakfast area looking at their computer or watching t.v.

Lovely lobby. The room was very nice, and the beds super-comfy. The place was peaceful & quiet - no disruptions from other guests. Even the shower pressure was good! The only issue I could mention is that breakfast during the week ends at 9 a.m., & I'm sorry, that's just too early - 10 a.m. would be far better.

The hotel was gorgeous – a welcoming lobby with colourful décor and everything smelled brand new. The room we stayed in included a king sized bed with pull-out couch for our daughter. We were pleasantly surprised by the room - from the fresh wallpaper to the modular furniture that we were able to move around to suit us. Everything was absolutely spotless! My daughter had her own tv and phone on that side of the room and a full desk with all the ports you could need. She found the pullout couch was very comfortable and our king sized bed was very plush with super-cozy pillows and the duvet was luxurious. The washroom was exceptionally spacious and I absolutely loved the shower. I would never in a million years consider having a bath in a bathtub in a hotel so having a more comfortable step into a shower stall was a nice departure from typical hotel washrooms. We were visiting the area for a baseball tournament and the living area with the pull out couch was spacious enough to host a small gathering of other parents who were staying at the hotel for drinks. The coffee machine, fridge and microwave were added bonuses. The complimentary hot breakfast was amazing! Our daughter loved the make-your-own-waffle station – the waffles were delicious! A wide range of breakfast food was available such as fresh fruit, cereal, yogurt and bagels. Fresh orange or apple juice was on tap and a nice variety of coffee and tea. The hotel itself backs on to a sleepy subdivision and there was no excessive noise from elevators or doors during our stay.There is a Tim Horton’s almost directly across the street from the hotel which is nice for grabbing a coffee on the way to and from and I would highly recommend the pizzeria just a few steps from the hotel – I grabbed 2 medium pizzas there between games and they were absolutely amazing. The kids and my husband enjoyed the pool area and hot tub. Towels were available in the area as well as a rest room area if you wanted to change downstairs which was handy. Lastly, if you want to stay in a comfortable hotel that is super clean and still smells brand new, I would highly recommend the Fairfield Inn and Suites in Barrie. If we have another tournament there next year, we would be happy to return!!

One issue that most should be aware of is that the hotel offers ""The Market"" which is advertised as ""24hr access to food and beverages...offers chilled beverages, snacks, sandwiches and salads"". The hotel is not really located anywhere near variety stores so The Market is one of the only viable options around for a quick snack. The prices at the market are, frankly, offensive. A 28g bag of chips (you read that right 28g not 280g.. the kind you get trick or treating) for example will run you a whopping $3.40. I understand a hotel taking a market advantage but those prices are completely out of whack. My suggestion is that to save guests feeling taken advantage those prices be re-visited. Seems petty but it isnt when your hungry at 11pm and have no where else to go.",4,positive
415136056,barrie/ca/154980/7622073/415136056.html,Fairfield Inn &amp; Suites Barrie,"Stayed here for the night a few weekends back as it was close to the venue we were attending and we loved it. The room is new, clean, beautiful and spacious for a hotel room.  The bathroom was great with the glass shower large enough for two to three people in length. My only concern with the shower stall is the floor is not textured to ensure a ""no slip"" issue. We did not have a slip issue , however if someone elderly took a spill it could be a more concerning outcome. The breakfast in the morning was good as it had a variety of food and juices.   If we stay overnight in Barrie again in the near future, this will be our place. Reasonable rate, courteous front desk staff and beautiful room.  As others stated it is not near the centre of the city, however a quick cab ride gets you there safely and costs 15-20 each way, which is a far cry from the retainer a lawyer will demand to represent you at your dd trial if you are out for a night on the town.",5,positive

51776061,barrie/ca/154980/815190/117966884.html,Barrie Motel,"My boyfriend and I needed a place to stay for a few days prior to moving back to Niagara. As students, we decided on the White Towers Motel because the owner offered us a decent rate for the multiple nights we'd be staying. almost immediately, we noticed that the door to our room didn't properly lock, but didn't think too much of it. It was only a few nights, what could possibly happen? At work, my girlfriends warned me against staying there - apparently the place is notorious for crack and prostitution and other such pleasant things. They begged me to stay with them instead, but I had already paid and moved my stuff in so i didn't bother. again, what could possibly happen? So one day I get off work early and was checking my emails in the room. I hear a yelling match outside between a woman and a man, thinking nothing of it. Then, the woman starts making weird grunting noises (watch The Exorcist). All I hear is banging and her screaming nonsense. So I text my boyfriend who is at work because I'm creeped out at this point, especially when I hear the doorknob being jiggled. I start to get up to get my shoes on and go for a drive when the door comes crashing open and a half-naked, bald woman stumbles in. I obviously freak out and lock myself in the washroom. She starts trying to get me out, all the while talking nonsense to herself. I start screaming for help and banging on the walls because the office was right next door to my room. I didn't have my cell with me because I panicked and ran in without it when the door flew open. No one came over to help me. I screamed and cried for forty minutes while she cursed at me and tried to get into the bathroom. I thought of crawling out through the window but decided to stay pressed between the bathtub and the door so she couldn't break in after me. Finally, the cops arrive because there were complaints of 'a naked woman among the snowbanks'. I come out shaking and terrified. The motel owner didn't even bother telling the police I was in there - I could've been stabbed and passed out in there and no one would've known, all they were told was that she was in room 15. The police informed me that she was a drugged up prostitute that they dealt with often and she would be locked up in the hospital for a few days. They called my boyfriend at work to let him know what happened because I was too shaken to do anything at this point. When he came by, he questioned the motel owner why he didn't come to my rescue, at least getting the psycho out of my room. Most people I know would try to intervene if they saw a 100 lb girl barracaded in a washroom while a naked crackhead threatened her from the other side of a door. The motel owner said he didn't want to get involved. Whatever. Then, instead of refunding us, he offered to get us another room for our last night because she peed on the bed in our's. We obviously refused to stay another night and it was a huge struggle to get our money back for that. My boyfriend kept trying to reason with the guy. He finally decided to give us $10 extra to pay for our dry cleaning because she was laying on my jacket when the cops finally arrived. And all this time we were super nice to him. Our heating would only work if he fiddled with the furnace, so a couple times a day we had to get him to take care of that for us. I felt bad bothering him, even though heat is a basic necessity, so we bought him a big container of Gummi Worms as a thank you. His idea of thank you was allowing me to experience the most traumatic event of my life and telling us to get out when we asked to be refunded. I'm pretty sure it's not a lot to ask for after my room was broken into and I was threatened....",1,negative

It looked like feces was stained on the sheets and the smell of the room was attrocious. It smelled like a mixture of dried cat urine and baby puke. I would rather sleep downtown Barrie then here ! It would be more safe as well ! As soon as we saw the room we left and figured we would rather sprend 100 dollars on a cab ride to sleep at home then in this motel. I wouldnt even call it a motel more like a dumpster. Next door we also heard a loud banging noise and it turned out there was 4 crack heads next door !

SO far. THE owners are trying to keep up a business and build a better motel while the rooms are not occupied. but from what i have seen so far the rooms are occupied ALOT. renovations take time and patience and i have seen personally the work being done to improve the building everyday. if you want to complain go ahead and speak your mind, but i have a feeling that a few complaints on here are the ones removed from the property due to misbehavior or arnt the type of individuals whom normally stay at a lower priced establishment. i keep saying for the value you pay the white towers is a great bang for your buck. i just cant wait untill all the repaires and renos are done just to see what happens when the rates go up and peole get upset because now it costs more to stay at the wtm where it has always been the CHEAPEST in barrie, yake care all and i hope this review hits home for somne out there looking for great value and comfort at a low price",4,positive

The floors were so disgusting we could not take our boots off. We stayed in room only long enough to find another hotel room and were refused a refund. Ended up getting some money back but had to pay $50 dollars for the snow on the rug. Like you could even see it for the filth. A lot of shady characters hanging around so we also did not feel safe. This was not the hotel we originally booked. We had made a reservation at Howard Johnson and were moved to this motel. The health board needs to close down this scumbag motel.

330532149,barrie/ca/154980/815190/330532149.html,Barrie Motel,"Stayed one night. The room was fine, very cold upon arrival, windows heating only. Room warmed up nicely, but bathroom freezing the entire time. Nice hot shower though.  My issue was with customer service. I reserved our room, and paid, through hotels.com the day before we were set to arrive. Upon arrival, the signage stated that a $50 deposit was required for the key, which was fine. However, we were charged a $90 deposit. That's fine too, it's just a deposit. When our card was ran, it declined, so we made a cash deposit of $100 American and was given $10 Canadian back. The whole thing was a bit confusing, but we had just driven 4 hours and I was battling a sinus infection so figured it was just me.   Once in our room, I checked my account and that is when I found our card had been compromised and someone went on a spending spree and cleared out our account - yay. I also noted that the charge for our room at the Barrie Motel had already gone through successfully the day before. I wanted everything to be crystal clear so I went back to the office to make sure the money we just gave was in fact a deposit and would be returned upon check out, because I was given nothing stating this. I was assured that was the case.  Lo and behold, checkout the next day was not simple. The man (same one we checked in with) was prepared to give me no money back, telling me that the $90 I gave him was to pay for the room. Which I still don't understand, because the charge for the room was not even that much. He pulled out a credit card receipt for $100 that I'm sure was fake (remember - mine declined!) and said that was for the deposit and he would refund it to my account. I told him that he could not do that since I had cancelled my card with the bank (due to the fraud thing) and the transaction would not go through. I also reminded him that I gave him $90 CASH so what he was proposing made absolutely no sense. He then tried to tell me that the cash I gave him was for the room and I said absolutely not, I paid for the room. He then tried to tell me I booked through expedia and that they do not accept payment. I told him no, I in fact booked through hotels.com, had a confirmation email saying so, and I pulled up my bank account on my phone and showed him the charge that clearly stated ""Barrie Motel"" for the price of the room. At this point I was pretty upset. With having the added frustration of someone having cleared out my bank account, the cash I had given him as a deposit was the money I needed to be able to drive home.   Finally it seemed that I was getting through to him when another woman walked in to check out. But then AGAIN, he attempted to refund money to my card and not give the cash. I made one more argument and he finally went and got the original $100 American that I had given him, probably only because another customer came in and heard my whole story (I gave him the $10 back - American as that's all i had left).  I would have gladly paid an extra however much to stay somewhere and not deal with this headache. The convenience was that it was close to the concert venue we were going to. Actually, while at the concert, a man approached us and said he had seen us at the Barrie Motel, and he was staying there also. He said he did not care much for his room, he was on the opposite side from us, so it sounded as if some rooms have been updated an others have not.  I would stay far away from this place, based on principle alone. Some shady business going on here.
